name: Aechmea distichantha
description: > 
  Aechmea distichantha is a large slow growing, basal-rosette, bromeliad
  typical of Cerrado vegetation in southern Brazil. It is also native to northern
  Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This shade-loving perennial will grow to a height
  of 60-90 cm.<br>It has arching strap-shaped, green/silver-grey leaves that are &gt;
  8 cm wide and up to 0.9 m long. The margins towards the apex have stout spines that
  are 3-5 mm long, but elsewhere the margins are entire. The leaveâ€™s apex has a needle-sharp
  terminal spine. Use extreme caution when handling this plant.<br>In late spring
  flowers appear on inflorescences on spikes, each with clusters, small blue, white
  or purple flowers about 25 mm long and subtended by showy pink bracts. Bromeliads
  flower only once, and then they die, but the inflorescence may last up to a month.
  Aechmea distichantha produces a white-woolly cylindrical berry-like fleshy fruit
  that persists for a few more weeks. Each fruit sets about 120 seeds, this production
  results in an average of 15,000 seeds inflorescence. Like most bromeliads, Aechmea
  distichantha produces offsets that replace the parent plant vegetatively.
