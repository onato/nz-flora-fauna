description: >
  
  Aeonium arboreum var. artopurpureum is a herbaceous perennial nursery
  produced cultivar. The parent Aeonium arboreum originates from the Canary Islands
  in the Atlantic Ocean. It is a short branching succulent shrub with maroon leaf
  rosettes with lime green centres. It goes to about 1m in height tall at maturity
  and can have spread of 600mm. Its succulent oval compound leaves emerge purple in
  spring, turning deep purple in colour throughout the season. From early to late
  summer bright yellow star-shaped flowers form pyramidal clusters on stems.
  
  The plant is [monocarpic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocarpic "Monocarpic")
  so the flowering stem will die when it flowers which is normally after about 10
  years.
  
  This species along with other Aeonium hybrids are found growing wild
  with other weed plants on the Port Hills and the Banks Peninsula, Canterbury.
