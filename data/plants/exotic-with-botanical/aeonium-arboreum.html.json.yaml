name: Aeonium arboreum
description: >
  Aeonium arboreum is a succulent, subtropical subshrub. It
  is native to the hillsides of the Canary Islands. It bears rosettes of leaves and
  large pyramidal panicles of bright yellow flowers in the spring.<br><br>The Aeonium
  species are indiscriminate breeders and just about any species will cross with any
  other species. "Pure" A. arboreum plants from the wild tend towards having quite
  thick, almost "meaty" leaves, many of the hybrid plants have a thinner leaf and
  some are also much narrower as well.
