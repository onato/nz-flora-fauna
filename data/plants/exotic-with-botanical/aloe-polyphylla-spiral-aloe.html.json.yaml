description: >
  Aloe polyphylla is endemic to the Kingdom of Lesotho in the Drakensberg
  mountains in South Africa, where it clings to rocky crevices and well-drained scree
  slopes. It is Lesotho''s national flower. It is a stemless aloe whose wide, serrated,
  grey-green leaves grow in a very distinctive five-pointed spiral pattern. The spiral
  can be in a clockwise or in an anti-clockwise direction.
  
  The leaves have sharp,
  dark leaf-tips. It will grow up to a metre in width. It rarely flowers but when
  it does it in Spring. Red-to-pink flowers are borne on branched inflorescences.
  
  Unfortunately,
  in its homeland of southern Africa, it is an endangered species that are threatened
  with extinction. There buying or collecting the plant is a criminal offence.
