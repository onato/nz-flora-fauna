name: Aloe striata
description: >
  Aloe striata is a small, stemless, evergreen, perennial, succulent,
  aloe species that naturally occurs on rocky slopes in coastal and semi-desert areas
  over the southern parts South Africa.
  
  Aloe striata grows &gt;45 cm tall and &gt;
  60 cm wide. The plant has a rosette of a few flat, broad, pale grey-green-pinkish
  leaves that vary in colour depending on the amount of sunlight. The leaves have
  a smooth, transparent, pink margin and subtle dark narrow lines running longitudinally.
  
  Clusters of coral-red flowers appear on 60 cm tall stems during spring. Up to
  three branched inflorescences can arise from a single rosette. Offsets will appear
  around the base and form a small colony.
