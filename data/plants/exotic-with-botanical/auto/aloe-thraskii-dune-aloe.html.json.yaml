name: Aloe thraskii
description: 'Aloe thraskii is a tall, robust, single-stemmed tree-like succulent
  that can reach up to 4 meters with a width of up to two meters. Its natural habitat
  is in dune vegetation along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape of South
  Africa. Aloe thraskii is classed as ''Near Threatened'' in its natural habitat due
  to habitat loss from urban and coastal development and illegal collecting for the
  specialist succulent horticultural trade.<br>It is a tall, fast-growing, unbranched
  Aloe, which develops a very large rosette. The long, pale, olive-green leaves with
  red-toothed margins are deeply concave and recurve downwards, sometimes even touching
  the skirt of old, dried leaves around the trunk. Spines are sometimes also present
  in a line down the middle of the lower leaf surface.<br>Aloe thraskii is a winter
  blooming species. The flowers are yellow with orange anthers and they grow on 15
  to 25 upright broadly-cylindrical erect racemes, on a multi-branched inflorescence.</p>
