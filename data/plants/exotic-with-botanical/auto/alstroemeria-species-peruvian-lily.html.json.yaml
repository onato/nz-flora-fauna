description: 'Many hybrids and about 190 cultivars of the genus Alstroemeria have
  been developed, with different markings and colours, ranging from white, golden
  yellow, and orange, to apricot, pink, red, purple, and lavender. The most popular
  and showy hybrids that are commonly grown today result from crosses between species
  from Chile (winter-growing) with species from Brazil (summer-growing).<br>The plants
  are distinctive vegetatively, with a rootstock consisting of a slender rhizome or
  group of rhizomes (the "crown"). Storage roots consist of sausage-like water storing
  structures "suspended" from the rhizome by major roots. In this way, the root system
  resembles that of dahlias. Above-ground shoots may be very short in some alpine
  Andean species (a few inches tall) or up to about 5 feet (1.5 m) tall in other species.
  Each year (more often in some hybrids) up to 80 new shoots are produced from the
  rootstock and each terminates in an umbel of a few up to 10 or so flowers.<br>Perhaps
  the most fascinating- and telltale morphological trait of Alstroemeria and its relatives
  is the fact that the leaves are resupinate, that is, they twist from the base so
  that what appears to be the upper leaf surface is, in fact, the lower leaf surface.
  This very unusual botanical feature is easily observed in the leaves on cut flowers
  from the florist.<br>The flowers of Alstroemeria are generally showy. All six tepals
  (tepal denotes either petal or sepal when both are similar, as in lilies, amaryllis,
  etc.) are roughly similar. In some species, two tepals are enlarged and vividly
  coloured and act as "flags" for pollination. The ovary is inferior and the seeds
  are hard and rounded.<br>This species can become invasive. <br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0006/0009/Alstroemeria_species__Peruvian_lily_-008.JPG"
