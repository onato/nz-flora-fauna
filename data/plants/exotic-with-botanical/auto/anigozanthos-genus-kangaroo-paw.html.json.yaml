description: 'Anigozanthos is a small genus of Australian plants in the Bloodwort
  family Haemodoraceae. The 11 species and several subspecies are commonly known as
  kangaroo paw and catspaw depending on the shape of their flowers. Kangaroo paw is
  the common name for a number of species that are endemic to the south-west of Western
  Australia. These perennial plants are noted for their unique bird attracting flowers.
  The tubular flowers are coated with dense hairs and open at the apex with six claw-like
  structures: from this paw formation the common name "kangaroo paw" is derived<br>Kangaroo
  Paws have brightly-coloured, large velvety flowers with no fragrance. They have
  a sturdy stem, which is a natural perch and makes them ideal flowers for fertilising
  by birds. Different species of the unusually shaped Kangaroo paws usually deposit
  pollen on different areas of the birds'' head. Thus, pollen from one species is
  unlikely to deposit in the flowers of another species.<br>Fine, brightly coloured
  hairs cover the flowers and are, sometimes, part of the stalk. Kangaroo Paw blooms
  during spring.<br><br>This common species is the Green Kangaroo paw, which ranges
  in colour from lemon yellow to emerald green.<a style="font-size: 1em; line-height:
