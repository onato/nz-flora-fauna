description: 'Arisaema candidissimum is a tuberous, perennial plant in the arum family
  (Araceae). It is native to western China where they grow at altitudes of 2,200–3,300
  m. <br>In late spring or early summer, this aroid develops 15 cm stalks bearing
  small, luminous, hooded spathes above the ground. The spathe is 8–10 cm long and
  are striped with translucent, white vertical veins. They can vary in colour, typically
  being white, often pinkish or greenish white or cream, with stripes which are green
  on the outside and pink on the inside.<br>The plants have two to three large, three-lobed,
  umbrella-like leaves (30-60cm) that don''t completely open &amp; develop until the
  flower is on full display. During autumn bright orange-red pods develop. This plant
  will self-seed.<br><br><a href="uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/Arisaema_candidissimum-flower.jpg"
