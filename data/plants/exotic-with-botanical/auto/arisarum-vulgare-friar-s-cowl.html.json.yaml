name: Arisarum vulgare
description: 'Arisarum vulgare is a herbaceous, perennial, with an underground rhizome.
  It is native to the Mediterranean region of southern Europe and northern Africa,
  east to the Caucasus, and west to the Canary Islands, the Azores and Madeira.<br>Arisarum
  vulgare is one of the smaller members of the Arum family growing to about 0.5 m
  in height. It can form large ground covering colonies by propagating vegetatively
  by tubers.</p> <p>During the summer months, it is not viable above ground and exists
  only as an underground tuberous rhizome. In winter and early spring, the rhizome
  grows new leaves and a short while later a flower appears above the surrounding
  vegetation. <br><br>The flower is surrounded by a tubular leaf whose top part is
  shaped like a hood, hence the common English name ''Friar''s cowl''. The flower
  has a curved tongue-like structure (spadix) growing out of it. The tubular leaf
  can vary in colour (green, purple, brown/bronze). The true flowers of the plant
  are attached to the spike. The female flowers are dark coloured and found at the
  very base of the spike and are located at one side, while the male flowers are pale
  yellow, lie above the female flowers and arranged around all the spike. They are
  pollinated by insects.<br>There are fewer female flowers than males flowers. The
  sexual parts of both sexes are hidden inside the flowers tubular spathe on the lower
  part of the club-shaped spadix. The female flower has a slightly swollen stigma,
  a short style and a spherical ovary embedded in the very base of the spadix spike.<br>The
  male flowers kidney shaped pollen sacks are attached to the spadix spike by a thick
  support structure. They produce pollen in large quantity.<br>The plants produce
  green round berries containing light brown seeds that have distinctive longitudinal
  ridges.<br><br>The green heart-shaped leaves and tubers are poisonous because they
  contain needle-like calcium oxalate crystals. These crystals cause an extremely
  unpleasant stinging sensation similar to needles being stuck into the lips, mouth
  and tongue if ingested.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/9993/Arisarum_vulgare__Friar_s_Cowl-002.JPG"
