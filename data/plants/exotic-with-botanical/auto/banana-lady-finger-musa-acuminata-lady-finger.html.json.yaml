description: 'Lady Finger bananas are diploid cultivars of Musa acuminate originally
  from Southeast Asia, Australia. ''Lady Finger'' is a standard-size plant which bears
  a thin-skinned fruit about 2.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length. Their fruits
  are small, thin-skinned, and very sweet. <br>The plants are normally fairly sturdy
  and are often mistaken for trees, but their main or upright stem is actually a pseudostem
  growing from a corm.<br>Each pseudostem can produce a single bunch of bananas. After
  fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots may develop from the base of the plant.
  Leaves are spirally arranged. They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the
  familiar frond look.<br>Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence,
  also known as the banana heart.<br>The banana fruits develop from the banana heart
  in a large hanging cluster made up of tiers (called hands) with up to 20 fruit to
  a tier.<br>The inflorescence contains many bracts (sometimes incorrectly called
  petals) between rows of flowers. The female flowers develop into fruit and appear
  in rows further up the stem from the rows of male flowers. The male banana flower
  is a large, dark purple-red blossom that grows from the end of a bunch of bananas.
  Its sizable bracts, or leaves, snugly enclose delicate, sweetly scented male flowers.</p>
