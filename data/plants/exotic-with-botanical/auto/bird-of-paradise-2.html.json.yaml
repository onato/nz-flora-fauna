description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">The flowers on the Birds of Paradise plant
  are most unusual. A series of highly coloured bracts (modified leaves) are formed
  into green, red, and or purplish canoe-like structures. Bracts vary between 10 to
  18 cm long depending on the age of the plant. Each flower is made up of three upright
  orange sepals and three highly modified vivid blue petals. Two of the petals are
  joined together in a structure resembling an arrowhead with the third petal forming
  a nectary at the base of the flower. <br>Each bract contains 2 or more protruding
  florets of bright yellow or orange elongated petals and a bright blue tongue. The
  female part of the flower is the long extension of the blue tongue, which is extended
  well away from the stamens. <br>Pollination occurs when a pollinator, usually a
  bird, lands on the arrowhead in search of nectar, the anthers are levered clear
  of the flower and deposit pollen on the breast of the bird. When the bird flies
  to another plant, this pollen is transferred to the stigma of the new flower. Then
  the resulting fruit is a leathery capsule containing numerous small seeds, each
  with an orange aril and an oil body, possibly to attract birds. <br><br><img src="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0000/3978/Bird_of_Paradise.JPG"
