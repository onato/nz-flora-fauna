name: Caltha palustris
description: 'Caltha palustris is a perennial herbaceous plant of the family Ranunculaceae
  (Buttercups), native to marshes, fens, ditches and wet woodland in temperate regions
  of the Northern Hemisphere. In the United Kingdom, it is probably one of the most
  ancient native plants, surviving the glaciations and flourishing after the last
  retreat of the ice, in a landscape inundated with glacial melt-waters. They grow
  in shallow water margins or damp soil, forming clumps (&gt; 80 centimetres high)
  of shiny green heart-shaped leaves. The leaves are rounded to kidney-shaped with
  two lobes, 3–20 centimetres across, with a bluntly serrated margin and of a thick,
  waxy texture. The stems are hollow.<br>The flowers are a bright yellow, 2–5 cm in
  diameter, with 4-9 (mostly 5) petal-like sepals and many yellow stamens; they appear
  in early spring to late summer. The flowers secreted nectar from small depressions,
  one on each side of each carpel. After fertilisation by insects and bees, the carpels
  form into green sac-like follicles &gt;1 cm long, each opening to release several
  seeds.<br><br>Caltha palustris is a highly polymorphic species, showing continuous
  and independent variation in many features. The photos below are of a form with
  double flowers. The common names for this form are ''Double Marsh Marigold'' and
  Double Kingcup ''Flore Pleno''.<br><br><img style="float: left;" src="uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Skull_and_crossbones1.jpg"

  Ranunculaceae, all parts of this plant are poisonous and can be an irritant. Skin
  rashes and dermatitis have been reported from excessive handling of the plant. It
  is known to have kill cows. <br><br>Double flower form.<br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0009/4803/Caltha_palustris_double_flower.JPG"
