description: '</p> <div>Canna (or Canna lily, although not a true lily) is a genus
  of nineteen species of flowering plants. The closest living relations to cannas
  are the other plant families of the order Zingiberales, that is the gingers, bananas,
  etc.</div> <p class="MsoNormal">The genus is native to tropical and subtropical
  regions of the New World, from the southern United States (southern South Carolina
  west to southern Texas) and south to northern Argentina.<br>Although all cannas
  are native to the New World, they have followed mankind''s journeys of discovery
  and some species are cultivated and naturalized in most tropical and sub-tropical
  regions.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">The species have large, attractive foliage and
  horticulturists have turned it into a large-flowered and bright garden plant. In
  addition, it is one of the world''s richest starch sources and is an agricultural
  plant. Although a plant of the tropics, most cultivars have been developed in temperate
  climates and are easy to grow in most countries of the world as long as they can
  enjoy at least 6â€“8 hours average sunlight during the summer.<br><br>The plants are
  large tropical and subtropical perennial herbs with a rhizomatous rootstock. The
  broad, flat, alternate leaves, that are such a feature of this plant, grow out of
  a stem in a long narrow roll and then unfurl. The leaves are typically solid green
  but some cultivars have glaucose, brownish, maroon, or even variegated leaves<br><br>There
  are many species and cultivars. The photo below is of the cultivar Canna x generalis
  ''Yellow King Humbert''<br>This lily was growing wild in a damp area.<br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0010/3523/Yellow_Canna_lily__Canna_x_generalis-003.JPG"
