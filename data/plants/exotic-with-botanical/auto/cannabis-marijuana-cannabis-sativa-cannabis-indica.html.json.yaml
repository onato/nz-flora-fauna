description: 'The Cannabis species are annual, dioecious, herbaceous plants in the
  Cannabis genus, a species of the Cannabaceae family. Cannabis grows wild throughout
  many tropical and humid parts of the world including India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh
  and Pakistan.<br>It is accepted that there are two main species, Cannabis sativa
  and Cannabis indica. The cross-breeding of these two types has led to a wide variety
  of hybrid strains.</p> <p>The distinguishing morphology between the two species.<br>The
  Sativa strains are tall, loosely branched and have long leaves with thin long blades.
  They are usually grown outdoors and can reach heights of up to 6 m.<br>The Indica
  strains are short, densely branched and tend to have broader, deeply serrated leaves
  and a compact and dense flower cluster. C. indica strains are the plants usually
  grown indoors.<br><br>Genetic factors dispose of a plant to become male or female.
  The flowers of the female plant are arranged in racemes and can produce hundreds
  of seeds. Male plants shed their pollen and die several weeks prior to seed ripening
  on the female plants.<br>People have cultivated Cannabis sativa throughout recorded
  history as a source of industrial fibre, seed oil, food, recreation, religious and
  spiritual moods, and medicine. Each part of the plant is harvested differently,
  depending on the purpose of its use.<br><br>There are three main cultivar groups
  of cannabis that are cultivated today:<br>Cultivars primarily cultivated for their
  fibre, characterised by long stems and little branching.<br>Cultivars are grown
  for seed which can be eaten entirely raw or from which hemp oil is extracted.<br>Cultivars
  grown for medicinal or recreational purposes.<br><br>The main active chemical in
  cannabis species is THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol). There are three main forms
  of cannabis: marijuana, hashish and hash oil. Marijuana is the most common and least
  powerful form of cannabis, consisting of the dried leaves and flowers of the plant.<br><br>For
