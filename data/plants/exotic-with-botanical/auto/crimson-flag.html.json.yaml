  comprises 65 species which are distributed through both the summer and winter rainfall
  areas of South Africa and Zimbabwe. The river lily Hesperantha coccinea is a flowering
  plant a member of the family Iridaceae (Iris family) from the summer rainfall area
  and is widely distributed through the eastern provinces of the country. The species
  name coccinea means ''scarlet'' and refers to the bright red flowers produced by
  this species but there are also pink and white forms. Until fairly recently this
  species was known by its old name Schizostylis coccinea. It grows from rhizomes
  and can spread rapidly if it finds a place to its liking. In its native countries,
  it is always close to water on the sandy saturated soils on stream banks growing
  in full sun where it was discovered in the 19th century by two plant explorers—Backhouse
  &amp; Harvey. The flowers often overhanging the stream. It is a herbaceous perennial
  plant growing to 60 cm tall, with slender lanceolate leaves up to 40 cm long and
  1 cm broad. The flowers normally bright red but there is also pink and white forms.
  30–35 mm long, with six petals; they are produced four to ten alternately on a spike
  in late summer to autumn. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens for
  its flowers and is used in floristry.</p> <p>Hesperantha coccinea flowering on the
