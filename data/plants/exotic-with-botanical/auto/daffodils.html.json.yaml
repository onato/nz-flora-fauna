  All Narcissus species have a central trumpet-, bowl-, or disc-shaped corona surrounded
  by a ring of six floral leaves called the perianth which is united into a tube at
  the forward edge of the 3-locular ovary. The seeds are black, round and swollen
  with a hard coat. The three outer segments are sepals, <p style="display: inline
  !important;"> and the three inner segments are petals. Though the traditional daffodil
  of folklore, poetry, and field may have a yellow to </p> golden-yellow color all
  over, both in the wild species and due to breeding, the perianth and corona may
  be variously coloured. Breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple,
  or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments, and several wild species also
  have known double variants. <p style="display: inline !important;">All Narcissus
  varieties contain the alkaloid poison lycorine, mostly in the bulb but also in the
  leaves.</p> One of the most common dermatitis problems for florists, "daffodil itch"
  involves dryness, fissures, scaling, and erythema in the hands, often accompanied

  by subungual hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin beneath the nails). It is blamed
  on exposure to calcium oxalate in the sap.<br><br>A selection of Narcissus cultivars.<br><a
