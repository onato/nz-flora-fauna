description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Dietes grandiflora is a rhizomatous perennial
  plant with long, rigid, sword-like green leaves belonging to the Iridaceae family
  and is native to South Africa.<br>The flowers are large (about 100mm across) and
  are white with yellow nectar guides and outer tepals and violet central segments.<br>Dark
  markings are found at the base of the outer tepals. The flowers are held on erect,
  slender stems which are about 1m in length.<br>These are borne in abundance during
  summer, especially after rain.<br>The flowers are borne in mass at certain periods,
  often after rain in summer. The individual flowers do not last more than a couple
  of days.<br>This plant is occasionally called the "Fairy Iris" because the fragile
  white petals not only look like fairy wings but also have a tendency to disappear
  mysteriously overnight!<br>Flowers are followed by 5 cm long green capsules that
  contain very shiny, dark brown seeds that are dispersed when the capsule splits
  open.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0002/9219/Dietes_grandiflora-001.JPG"
