  morning and wither during the following night, possibly replaced by another one
  on the same scape (flower stalk) the next day. Some species are night-blooming.<br>Hemerocallis

  worldwide because of the showy flowers and hardiness. Daylily cultivar flowers are

  enthusiasts and professional horticulturalists. There are over 60,000 registered
  cultivars.<br><br>Photos below is a popular cultivar “Hemerocallis Stella Bella”.<br><a
