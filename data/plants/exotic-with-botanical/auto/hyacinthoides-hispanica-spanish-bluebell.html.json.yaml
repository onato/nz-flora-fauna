name: Hyacinthoides hispanica
description: '</p> <p>Hyacinthoides hispanica is a spring-flowering bulbous perennial
  native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is one of around 11 species in the genus Hyacinthoides.
  It is distinguished from the common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) by having
  its paler flowers all the way around the central stem while the common bluebell
  flowers are on one side and tend to bow over at the top with the weight of its flowers.
  Hyacinthoides hispanica petals are less recurved and have blue anthers (where the
  common bluebell has creamy-white ones) and have little or no scent compared to the
  strong fragrant scent of the northern Hyacinthoides species. The leaves are also
  broader.</p> <p>Where the Spanish bluebell has been introduced in the United Kingdom
  it has become an invasive species. The two species hybridise freely, and the resulting
  hybrid Hyacinthoides Ã— massartiana. This hybrid and the Spanish bluebell both produce
  highly fertile seeds and can invade areas of the native common bluebell. The Spanish
  bluebell is also cultivated as a garden plant, and several named cultivars exist
  with flowers in various shades of white, pink and blue.<br><br>A spreading area
