description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Dietes grandiflora is a rhizomatous perennial
  plant with long, rigid, sword-like green leaves. Grows up to 75cm in clumps. This
  species is a native South Africa, where it is often used in public gardens, beautification
  of commercial premises and along roadsides.<br>The iris shaped blooms are white
  marked with yellow and blue centres and appear summer to autumn. Dark markings are
  found at the base of the outer tepals. These are borne in abundance during summer,
  especially after rain. Flowers are followed by 5 cm long green capsules that contain
  very dark brown seeds, these are dispersed when the capsule dries and splits open.<br><br><a
