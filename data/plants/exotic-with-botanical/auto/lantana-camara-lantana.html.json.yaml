  style="font-size: 12px;">Lantana camara is a species of flowering plant in the verbena
  family, Verbenaceae and is native to the American tropics. It has been introduced
  into other parts of the world as an ornamental plant and is now considered an invasive
  species in many tropical and sub-tropical areas including New Zealand where it is
  listed in the National Pest Plant Accord. L. camara has invaded large areas in India,
  Australia and much of Africa. It colonizes new areas when its seeds, as these are
  dispersed by birds especially silver eyes. The plant is a branched, pleasant-smelling,
  hairy, somewhat prickly perennial shrub up to 3 m tall. Itâ€™s small, tubular flowers
  up to 1 cm in diameter and is in dense inflorescences on slender stalks up to 10
  cm long in the leaf axils. They are of variable colour, usually changing from cream
  or yellow to pink, purplish-pink to rose. <br>The juicy round drupes (berries) about
  5 mm in diameter are poisonous. The drupes are initially green, ripening to deep
  purple or black. Leaves are in opposite pairs, crinkled, with rough hairs on the
  upper surface, soft-hairy underneath. They are bluntly-toothed, egg-shaped or heart-shaped,
  up to 13 cm long by 7 cm wide, on stalks up to 2 cm long. The stems are square,
  with a pithy core. Erect to spreading or scrambling, usually with curved-back prickles.
  Found on roadsides and waste places in warm districts.</p> <a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0003/4249/Lantana__Lantana_camara_.JPG"
