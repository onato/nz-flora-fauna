  dark, glossy, green leaves are up to 30 cm long and 25 mm wide. They are basal,
  sessile, strap-shaped and form an upright, vase-shaped clump of foliage. <br>The

  chambers and during flood events, they are carried downstream and are deposited
  on river banks.<br>Leucojum aestivum bulbs are up to 4 cm across.<br><br><img src="uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-Summer_Snowflake_(Leucojum_aestivum)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_942436.jpg"
