description: 'Plectranthus ciliatus is a South Africa trailing or straggling herb
  which has very vigorous runners that spread along the ground. The undersides of
  the leaves and the veins that show through to the upper side are purple.Its stems
  are covered in purple hairs that form runners and root at nodes. It has hairy oval,
  textured leaves (5-12 x 3-7 cm) with serrated edges are in opposite pairs and are
  purple underneath below and dotted with glands. It develops erect stems (up to 30
  cm tall) of tubular white flowers (1 cm long) with purple dots inside lower lip
  followed by small dark brown nutlets. No seed is produced in New Zealand. It spreads
  by runners and these are moved around in the soil and with green waste dumping.<br>It
  is common in gardens where it forms dense mats, similar to tradescantia, that prevent
  seedlings of native species from establishing, leading to eventual thinning of the
  canopy and the area being opened up to invasion by other weedy vines and shrubs.
  It is found in damp shaded habitats, especially disturbed forest, shrubland, stream
  sides, river systems and wetlands throughout New Zealand.</p> <p>This plant is listed
  in the New Zealand''s National Pest Plant Accord<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0001/9149/Plectranthus_ciliatus-7.JPG"
