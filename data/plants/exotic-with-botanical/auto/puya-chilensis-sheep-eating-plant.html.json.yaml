name: Puya chilensis
description: 'Puya chilensis is an evergreen perennial drought and sun tolerant bromeliad
  originating from the arid hillsides of the Andes Chile. Unlike tree-dwelling Bromeliads,
  Puya chilensis has fully-functional roots and grows terrestrially, much like a cactus
  or succulent. It is common on north-facing slopes of matorral areas at 300-1000
  m above sea level whereby spreading by offsets it forms huge impenetrable colonies.<br>Puya
  chilensis forms large, dense rosettes of pale grey-green, strap-like leaves which
  are up to 1 m. long by 3.5 cm wide. The outer two-thirds of the leaf blade bear
  outward pointing spines which may be an adaptation to prevent herbivores from reaching
  the centre of the plant. The plant is colloquially known as the “Sheep-eating plant”
  for its bizarre method of eating. Sheep and other animals get caught on its sharp
  spines and then starve to death. When the animal decays, the plant absorbs the animal''s
  nutrients, like a fertilizer.<br>Growth is slow and plants may take fifteen to twenty
  years or more to flower. Flowering usually occurs in spring, however, if the water
  supply conditions are optimal it can bloom all year. The actual flowerhead is up
  to 1m long and packed with racemes of neon bright, green-yellow chunky flowers with
  bright orange anthers. The flowerheads are borne on 2m high spikes and resemble
  a medieval mace with flower spikes sticking out in all directions. The individual
  waxy blooms measure 6-8cms long and they can contain enough nectar for a person
  to drink. Birds pollinate these flowers when they perch on the outward-pointing
  sterile tips and drink the sweet nectar inside the deep receptacle. Bees are also
  pollinators. Flowering lasts about a week then the inflorescence dries and seeds
  are formed. The plant is <a title="Monocarpic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocarpic">monocarpic</a>
  so the flowering stem will die when it flowers.<br>Native Chileans used this plant
  in folk medicine as an emollient and astringent. The tender parts of the leaves
  are sold by street vendors. They are finely chopped up an eaten as a salad. Their
  stalks are used to extract and manufacture fibre cords. This fibre was used to make
  fishing nets.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0006/4469/Puya_chilensis-008.JPG"
