description: '</p> <p>Trifolium pratense (Red Clover) is a species of clover, native
  to Europe, western Asia and northwest Africa, but planted and naturalised in many
  other regions. It is herbaceous, short-lived perennial plant, variable in size,
  growing to 20-80 cm tall. The leaves are alternate, trifoliate (with three leaflets),
  each leaflet 15-30 mm long and 8-15 mm broad, green with a characteristic pale crescent
  in the outer half of the leaf; the petiole is 1-4 cm long, with two basal stipules.
  The flowers are dark pink with a paler base, 12-15 mm long, produced in a dense
  inflorescence. It is widely grown as a fodder crop in New Zealand and is also valued
  for its nitrogen fixation which increases soil fertility. <br>Red Clover contains
  isoflavones (estrogen-like compounds) which promote oestrogen production and which
  may enhance fertility in women and boost oestrogen levels in women with oestrogen
  deficiencies. In addition, the Red Clover contains calcium and magnesium which can
  relax the nervous system and improve fertility. The isoflavones (like irilone and
  pratensein) and phytoestrogens from red clover have been used to treat the symptoms
  of menopause. It has also been reported that red clover has been used for a variety
  of medicinal purposes, such as bronchitis, burns, cancers, ulcers, sedation, and
  asthma.<br><a style="font-size: 1em;" href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0001/0099/Trifolium_pratense__Red_Clover.JPG"
