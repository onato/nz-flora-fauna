name: Sisyrinchium bermudiana
description: 'Sisyrinchium bermudiana is a perennial plant of the Sisyrinchium genus
  (of the iris family). Is a small, tufted perennial of wet pastures, lake shores
  and grass verges that is widespread in North America and has its European presence
  principally in Northern Ireland.<br>Flowers are produced during spring and each
  one lasts only a day or two. The small, star-like, pale to bright blue flowers have
  contrasting yellow centres. They open only in bright sunlight.<br>Sisyrinchium bermudiana
  usually grows to 20 cm in height but can sometimes reach 40 cm.<br>In good growing
  conditions, blue-eyed grass can become locally abundant, spreading in an invasive
  weedy manner. The plant often possesses a short thickened, horizontal underground
  stem which provides food storage over the winter period, and this also allows the
  individual plant to increase in size and form a tight clump.<br><br>Photographed
