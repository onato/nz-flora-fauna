description: 'Yucca gloriosa is a medium-sized species of flowering plant occurring
  naturally in coastal sand dunes from North Carolina to Florida. It is also widely
  cultivated as an ornamental worldwide. There are many forms and hybrids.<br>In autumn
  it usually has a single panicle up to 2.5 m long, topped by a cluster of nodding,
  bell-shaped cream sometimes tinged purple or red flowers.<br>The glaucous, dark
  green leaves are spine-tipped, stiff and are up to 60cm in length and 2-3.5 cm wide.
  The entire margins are smooth but they can be rarely finely denticulate. The plant
  can grow to heights above 5 m.<br>Fruit is a leathery, elongate berry up to 8 cm
  long.<br><br>Yucca gloriosa has been known to cause skin irritation and even allergic
  reactions upon contact. The leaf points are even sharp enough to break the skin.</p>
