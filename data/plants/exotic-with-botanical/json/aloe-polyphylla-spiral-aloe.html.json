  "description": "Aloe polyphylla is endemic to the Kingdom of Lesotho in the Drakensberg mountains in South Africa, where it clings to rocky crevices and well-drained scree slopes. It is Lesotho's national flower. It is a stemless aloe whose wide, serrated, grey-green leaves grow in a very distinctive five-pointed spiral pattern. The spiral can be in a clockwise or in an anti-clockwise direction.<br>The leaves have sharp, dark leaf-tips. It will grow up to a metre in width. It rarely flowers but when it does it in Spring. Red-to-pink flowers are borne on branched inflorescences.<br>Unfortunately, in its homeland of southern Africa, it is an endangered species that are threatened with extinction. There buying or collecting the plant is a criminal offence.<br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/8764/Aloe_polyphylla__Spiral_aloe.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/8764/Aloe_polyphylla__Spiral_aloe.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/Aloe_polyphylla_3-001.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/Aloe_polyphylla_3-001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/%20\" target=\"_blank\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ </a><br><br></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
