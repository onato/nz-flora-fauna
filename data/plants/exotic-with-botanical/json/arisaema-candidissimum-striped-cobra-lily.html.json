  "description": "Arisaema candidissimum is a tuberous, perennial plant in the arum family (Araceae). It is native to western China where they grow at altitudes of 2,200–3,300 m. <br>In late spring or early summer, this aroid develops 15 cm stalks bearing small, luminous, hooded spathes above the ground. The spathe is 8–10 cm long and are striped with translucent, white vertical veins. They can vary in colour, typically being white, often pinkish or greenish white or cream, with stripes which are green on the outside and pink on the inside.<br>The plants have two to three large, three-lobed, umbrella-like leaves (30-60cm) that don't completely open &amp; develop until the flower is on full display. During autumn bright orange-red pods develop. This plant will self-seed.<br><br><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/Arisaema_candidissimum-flower.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/Arisaema_candidissimum-flower.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br></p> <p>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information:<a href=\"%20https:/creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"> https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
