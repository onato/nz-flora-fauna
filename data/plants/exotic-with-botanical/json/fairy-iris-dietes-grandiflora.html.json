  "description": "</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dietes grandiflora is a rhizomatous perennial plant with long, rigid, sword-like green leaves belonging to the Iridaceae family and is native to South Africa.<br>The flowers are large (about 100mm across) and are white with yellow nectar guides and outer tepals and violet central segments.<br>Dark markings are found at the base of the outer tepals. The flowers are held on erect, slender stems which are about 1m in length.<br>These are borne in abundance during summer, especially after rain.<br>The flowers are borne in mass at certain periods, often after rain in summer. The individual flowers do not last more than a couple of days.<br>This plant is occasionally called the \"Fairy Iris\" because the fragile white petals not only look like fairy wings but also have a tendency to disappear mysteriously overnight!<br>Flowers are followed by 5 cm long green capsules that contain very shiny, dark brown seeds that are dispersed when the capsule splits open.<br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0002/9219/Dietes_grandiflora-001.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0002/9219/Dietes_grandiflora-001.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0002/9214/Dietes_grandiflora.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0002/9214/Dietes_grandiflora.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a></p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
