  "description": "</p> <p>This cultivar Hylotelephium telephium 'Purple Emperor' is a succulent perennial whose original parents are native to Eurasia. Hylotelephium telephium subsp. maximum 'Atropurpureum' was one parent, although the other is still a mystery. Its common name 'Purple Emperor' was named after a rare Eurasian butterfly Apatura iris. This cultivar was first spotted as a seedling by Graham Gough, of Marchants Hardy Plants, growing in his parents' garden in East Sussex.<br>It is a fast-growing, compact, deciduous, herbaceous perennial which grows &gt;50cm tall and has broad, plum-black leaves which are whorled in threes at the top of each erect dark red stem. Rounded clusters of small, pale purplish-pink flowers develop in late summer. These heads of tiny flowers are very attractive to bees, butterflies and hoverflies.<br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/6183/1-Hylotelephium_telephium__Purple_Emperor__.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/6183/1-Hylotelephium_telephium__Purple_Emperor__.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a> <br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/6188/1-Hylotelephium_telephium__Purple_Emperor__-001.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/6188/1-Hylotelephium_telephium__Purple_Emperor__-001.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a> <br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/6193/1-Hylotelephium_telephium__Purple_Emperor__-002.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/6193/1-Hylotelephium_telephium__Purple_Emperor__-002.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a> <br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/6198/1-Hylotelephium_telephium__Purple_Emperor__-003.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/6198/1-Hylotelephium_telephium__Purple_Emperor__-003.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a> <br><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information:<a href=\"%20https:/creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\"> https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a><br></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
