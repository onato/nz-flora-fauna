  "description": "Lamium maculatum is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native throughout Europe and temperate Asia (Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, and western China).<br>Lamium maculatum is prostrate, spreading herbaceous perennial. It is very variable in terms of leaf size, shape, hairiness and in colour. <br>The crinkled leaves shape varies from ovate-triangular to heart-shaped. They have rounded marginal teeth and are unpleasantly scented when bruised.<br>Lamium maculatum has erect, hollow and pubescent stems that are only branched at the base.<br>The inflorescence bears about two to eight hermaphrodite flowers about 20â€“30 millimetres long. The flowers of the plant are formed in the leaf axils of the upper leaf pairs. The upper lips of the flowers are helmet-shaped, usually pink or purplish, while the bilobate lower ones are whitish with purple dots. The stamens are located in the upper lip and have orange pollen. <br>Lamium maculatum is valued as a groundcover in moist, shady areas. It will rapidly colonise an area and may become invasive given suitable growing conditions.<br><br><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-Lamium_maculatum.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-Lamium_maculatum.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0013/4673/1-Lamium_maculatum_-002.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0013/4673/1-Lamium_maculatum_-002.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0013/4678/1-Lamium_maculatum_-003.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0013/4678/1-Lamium_maculatum_-003.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a><br></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
