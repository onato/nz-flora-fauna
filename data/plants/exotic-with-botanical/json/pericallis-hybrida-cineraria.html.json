It originated as a hybrid between Pericallis cruenta and P. lanata, both natives of the Canary Islands. The hybrid was first developed in the British royal gardens in 1777. It was originally known as Cineraria × hybrida, but the genus Cineraria is now restricted to a group of South African species, with the Canary Island species being transferred to the genus Pericallis; some botanists also treat it in a broad view of the large and widespread genus Senecio.<br>The plant forms a mound with foliage that is generally ovate, light green, softly hairy. When in bloom (winter/spring) it is covered in corymbs of daisy-like flowers. The flowers can vary and are often bi coloured, formerly the colours were vivid but now they can be in pastel shades.<br>There are named hybrids and strains in an astonishing range of deep and more pastel colours.<br>Propagation is by its tiny seeds (&gt;100,000 per 28gm depending on the strain). <br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0012/6243/Cineraria.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0012/6243/Cineraria.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br>Flowering New Plymouth September at Tupare Gardens<br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0009/4188/Cineraria___Genus_Pericallis.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0009/4188/Cineraria___Genus_Pericallis.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0009/4208/Cineraria____Genus_Pericallis-005.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0009/4208/Cineraria____Genus_Pericallis-005.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a>    <br><br>The large leaf.<br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0009/4198/Cineraria____Genus_Pericallis-002.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0009/4198/Cineraria____Genus_Pericallis-002.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a><br><br> <br style=\"clear:both;\">          \t \n          <div class=\"hr\">\n          </div>\t \n          \n",
