  "description": "Doryanthes excelsa is a flowering plant indigenous to the coastal areas of New South Wales near Sydney. <br>Each plant grows from a thickened under­ground stem which is gradually pulled deeper and deeper into the ground by the roots contracting during periods of dry weather. <br>The plant forms a large clump with numerous sword-like fibrous leaves, to 1 m in length and up to 100 mm wide. The red, trumpet-like flowers each 100 mm across are borne in a compact terminal head 300 mm in diameter on a leafy flowering stem 6 m high. For this reason, and because they are surrounded by brown bracts, the flowers are not seen clearly from the ground. Flowering occurs from September to November. The fruit is a woody capsule which splits open on ripening in Janu­ary or February to release the brown, flattened and slightly winged seeds.<br>The name \"Gymea Lily\" is derived from a local Eora dialect (indigenous people of Australia,). Dory-anthes means spear-flower in Greek, and excelsa is Latin for exceptional. The Sydney suburbs of Gymea and Gymea Bay are named after the lily.<br><br>The genus Doryanthes was first described in 1802 by the Portuguese priest, statesman, philosopher and botanist José Francisco Correia de Serra (1750–1823), a close friend of Sir Joseph Banks. Doryanthes excelsa has also inspired the naming of Doryanthes, the journal of history and heritage for Southern Sydney founded by Dharawal historian Les Bursill. <br>Honey-eaters birds love the nectar of these large, crimson flowers on stems up to 6m tall<br><br>Aboriginal people in the Lake Macquarie district of NSW were observed in 1836 roasting the stems, having cut them when half a meter high and as thick as a person's arm. They also roasted the roots which they made into a sort of cake to be eaten cold.</p> <div> <p>The plant below was photographed on Frankley Road above Mill Road, New Plymouth.<img style=\"font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4em;\" src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0004/1869/Spear_Lily___Doryanthes_excelsa_-001.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></p> </div> <p>Flowers early October with two feeding Wax-eyes <em>Zosterops lateralis</em><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0004/2074/Spear_Lily___Doryanthes_excelsa-002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0004/2074/Spear_Lily___Doryanthes_excelsa-002.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0004/1879/Spear_Lily___Doryanthes_excelsa_.JPG\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0004/1879/Spear_Lily___Doryanthes_excelsa_.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a></p> <p>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a></p> <p> </p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
