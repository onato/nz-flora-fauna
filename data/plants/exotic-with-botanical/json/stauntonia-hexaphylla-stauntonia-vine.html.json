It can grow to 10 m high and can have a spread of 7 m.<br>It has palmate leaves composed mostly of between three and seven leathery, elliptic leaflets. <br>In later in spring racemes of fragrant small, white pastel-purple coloured, bell-shaped, 2 cm flowers develop. <br>This vine is dioecious. Male and female flowers are on racemes on separate plants. Male and female plants are needed to produce fruit. It is not self-fertile and needs insects or pollination by hand to produce fruit.<br>Flowers are followed by edible, ovoid, purplish, 5cm fruits.<br>The fruits are eaten raw or cooked. They are sweet with a honey-like flavour. It is highly esteemed as a dessert fruit in Japan.</p> <p><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-Stauntonia_hexaphylla4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-Stauntonia_hexaphylla4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a></p> <p><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-Stauntonia_hexaphylla5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-Stauntonia_hexaphylla5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-1280px-Stauntonia_hexaphylla_(fruits_s2).jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-1280px-Stauntonia_hexaphylla_(fruits_s2).jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-S.%20hexaphylla.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><br><br><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-1280px-Stauntonia_hexaphylla_(leaf_s2).jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Plants/1-1280px-Stauntonia_hexaphylla_(leaf_s2).jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
