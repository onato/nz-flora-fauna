description: >
  Acaena profundeincisa is an uncommon, lush
  blue-green form of Piripiri from alpine regions. It grows to a height of 0.1m and
  a spread of 1m. The spurs covering the bur fruit casing enable its dispersal by
  catching onto passing fauna. It is sold by specialised native nurseries.
