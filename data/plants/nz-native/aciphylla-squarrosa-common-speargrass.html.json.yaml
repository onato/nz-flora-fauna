name: Aciphylla squarrosa
description: >
  Aciphylla squarrosa is native to New Zealand is found in both North
  Island and South Island in coastal to low-alpine areas from East Cape to North Canterbury.
  A. squarrosa can withstand temperatures down to -28ยบ C.
  
  It forms a dense cluster
  up to the 1m high of spiky three-pinnate leaves. The narrow blue-green leaves are
  highly divided with rigid serrated or crenulated margins and midrib and with pungent
  tips. These will pierce tramping boots. <br>During November to January sweet-scented
  star-shaped yellow flowers on a compound, umbels are carried on a stalk up 1 m high.
  These stalks are also covered in razor-sharp spears presumably as a defence against
  animals such as the now extinct moa from eating it.
