name: Aciphylla subflabellata
description: >
  Aciphylla subflabellata forms an open cluster of spiky leaves. The very
  narrow grey-green leaves are highly divided, up to 60 cm long. In summer the yellow
  flowers are carried on a stalk that can be up 1 m high. Seed heads are formed during
  February â€“ May. These seed heads are protected by the bract segments being aligned
  vertically to form a cage around the seeds.
  
  Aciphylla subflabellata is found
  in montane to subalpine (300-1400 m a.s.l.) in the eastern regions of the South
  Island, New Zealand, from north Canterbury to South Otago. This widespread but not
  common Aciphylla is browsed where accessible by sheep cattle, rabbits and hares.
