  Anaphalioides trinervis is a native perennial herb with a decumbent
  habit. Its habitat is partially shaded moist banks, such stream sides or the edges
  of waterfalls. The leaves (7Ã—15 mm) are a bright green with a prominent midrib
  and pair of parallel lateral veins. The underside of leaves is a whitish colour.<br>Inflorescences
  of about 10 white 1cm straw-like flowers with yellow centres develop on 15 cm stems.
  Pappate cypselae are dispersed by wind. Anaphalioides trinervis found in the
  North Island and halfway down the South Island. It has been reported on the Curtis

  for juices which were then applied to bruises.
