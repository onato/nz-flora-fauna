description: >
  Anisotome aromatica is a small rosette forming
  dioecious plant of alpine areas throughout New Zealand. It has pinnate leaves 3-12
  cm long. It develops a flower stalk with a compound head with many small white flowers.
  The female plant usually has a smaller flower head with fewer flowers. It bears
  the small brown fruits. It grows in alpine, subalpine rocky places, grasslands,
  herbfields and fellfields. It is present on the herbfields of Mt Egmont/Taranaki.
  At higher altitudes the plants are dwarfs. At lower levels, the plants can be up
  to 50cm tall. There are three names varieties of the alpine zone. Distinguishing
  them is a problem.
