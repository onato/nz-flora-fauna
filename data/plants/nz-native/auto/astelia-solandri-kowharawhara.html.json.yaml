description: 'Astelia solandri is an evergreen rhizomatous perennial commonly growing
  as a tufted as epiphytes on ageing trees but it also occasionally grows on the ground.
  One of 13 native species of astelia in NZ this is the only one that commonly perches.
  The species generally grow in forests, swamps and amongst low alpine vegetation.
  It is common in the Kamahi forests on Mt. Taranaki.<br>It has leaves up to 1-2m
  long and they are narrow, silvery beneath, with three deep grooves.<br>The yellowish-white,
  sweetly scented flowers are dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female,
  but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants
  must be present if seeds are to be produced.) The plant is not self-fertile.<br>It
  develops small, rounded fruit which is a translucent green to yellow or brown.<br><br><a
