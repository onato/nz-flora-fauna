description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Acaena inermis purpurea is most commonly found
  on the eastern side of the South Island in montane gravelly riverbeds and tussock
  grasslands where it has good drainage.<br>This is a vigorous, hardy, herbaceous
  groundcover plant spreads to about 1m, and is a purple-leaved form of the less commonly
  grown grey-leaved Acaena inermis. It has fine, feathery foliage which hugs the ground
  although its leaves can grow as high as 5cm if growing in light shade when the colour
  will change from purple to a grey-purple.<br>In early summer creamy white flowers
  appear on short stems, and brownish green sepals and white anthers. <br>Acaena inermis
  ''Purpurea'' unlike most species of Acaena (Bidibid) it doesn''t have barbs on the
  spines of its seed heads and does not adhere to clothes or pets. The Latin name
  Inermis means unarmed.<br><br>Photographed at <a style="border-style: initial !important;
