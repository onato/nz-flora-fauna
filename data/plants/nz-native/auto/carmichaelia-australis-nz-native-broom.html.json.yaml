description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Carmichaelia australis is a very unusual plant.
  It grows to a height of 3 - 5m and is hardy and fast growing and is multi-trunked
  from the base. It is found in lowland and mid-montane sited throughout New Zealand
  except in the far south. It has been recorded at the White Cliffs, North Taranaki.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The adult has tiny inconspicuous leaves. Instead of leaves,
  the stems are flattened to catch the sunlight. This native broom grows in shrublands
  and forest margins where it prefers full sunlight. In spring through to summer,
  it has small 5-6 mm white flowers with purple veins and sometimes has purple centres.
  The seeds are yellow, orange or red often with black dots. The seeds are distributed
  when the seed pod bursts so seed travels only short distances, compared to wind
  and bird-dispersed seed.<br><br>Carmichaelia australis growing along the Riverlands,
