description: 'Carmichaelia petriei is a stout, erect, openly much branched leafless
  New Zealand broom up to c. 2 m. tall and grows in coastal lowland areas to montane
  grasslands east of the Southern Alps from the McKenzie country to Central Otago
  and central Southland.<br>The branches are round and have distinctive yellow pointed
  tips. It seldom has leaves as the green stems take their place in dry places, the
  stems may be a yellow-green while in less dry areas they tend to be greener.<br>It
  small mauve flowers (6mm by 5mm) similar to those of sweet peas are produced from
  small notches on the stem. The flowers are white flushed with purple and with purple
  veining on the keel. The seedpods are 8-10mm long and are dark brown/black. The
  seeds are greenish yellow and sometimes are mottled with black.<br>Grazing stock
  and hares have a considerable effect on this plant.<br><br>Photographed at Otari
