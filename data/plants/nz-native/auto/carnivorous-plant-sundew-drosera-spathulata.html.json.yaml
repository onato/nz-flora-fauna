description: 'Drosera spatulata, the spoon-leaved sundew, is a variable, rosette-forming
  sundew with spoon-shaped leaves. The specific epithet is Latin for "spatula-shaped,"
  a reference to the form of the leaves. This sundew has a large range and occurs
  naturally throughout south-east Asia, in southern China and Japan, Micronesia, New
  Guinea through to the eastern territories of Australia and Tasmania and New Zealand.
  Variants are often known by the localities in which they are found. The plant does
  not form hibernacula in winter.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Drosera spatulata is a
  variable perennial plant that produces small rosettes of numerous spathulate leaves.
  This species is widely variable, but generally, plants are about 4 cm in diameter.
  Each leaf is attached to the central rosette by a narrow 8 mm long petiole that
  is only glandular on the upper half. Individual leaf laminae are typically 5 mm
  long and 4 mm wide. In early summer, plants will produce 8 cm tall erect scapes
  with around six small white flowers on each one-sided racemose inflorescence. Each
  flower can be up to 6 mm across. Sundews are one of the plants that can live in
  an acidic environment. <br><br>Click photos to enlarge<br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/1959/Drosera_spathulata__Spoon-leaved_Sundew_-008.JPG"><img
