description: '</p> Found only in New Zealand''s South Island. <p class="MsoNormal"><br>Aciphylla
  horrida is large alpine herb growing up to 1m in moist tussock herb field or open
  mountain shrubland. It belongs to the genus Aciphylla of the Umbelliferae (carrot
  family). They grow tussock-like clumps with large leaves which are deeply divided
  into hard, rigid segments tipped by needle-sharp spines.<br>The yellow flower stems
  grow to 1.5m in summer. The flower and the later seed, heads are dense, narrow and
  lance-like. These individual flower clusters are densely aggregated on the upper
  parts of the lances. These are exceeded in length by their associated bracts. These
  bracts have segments as spiny as those of the leaves consisting of thousands of
  little flowers surrounded by small spines. <br>It is suggested that the excessive
  spininess is a defence against browsing animals in pre-human times in New Zealand
  which would have been the moas.<br>The Maoris used a rope to pull the plant out
  of the ground to get the tubers for food. The rest of the plant was hung above a
  fire to extract a sweet-smelling resin that was used as chewing gum and the moulding
  of jewellery.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0002/1209/Horrid_Spaniard___Aciphylla_horrida-1.JPG"
