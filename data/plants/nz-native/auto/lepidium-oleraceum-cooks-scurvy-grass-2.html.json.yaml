name: Lepidium oleraceum
description: '</p> <p>Lepidium oleraceum is a nationally endangered much-branched,
  perennial, herb up to 1 x 1 m high. Once a widespread common coastal plant it is
  now rare. It is now mostly restricted to off-shore rock stacks and offshore islands.
  It is still found on Stewart Island, the Three Kings Islands, Kermadec Island group,
  the Snares Islands, the Chatham Islands, the Auckland Islands, the Antipodes Islands,
  Stewart Islands and the Bounty Islands group. It is usually found in soil enrich
  by guano near seabird roosts and nesting sites. The species is now mainly found
  on rock stacks, islets, and wind shorn headlands on rodent-free offshore islands.
  <br>The small populations left are highly threatened, one of the reasons being reduced
  populations of seabirds which they are dependent on to provide highly fertile and
  disturbed soils associated with nesting grounds. Additionally, the species is susceptible
  to browsing by livestock, rodents, snails, and insect herbivores.</p> <p>Young leaves
  were once eaten raw or cooked. They have a hot cress-like taste and are a rich source
  of vitamin C. Cook used it as an antiscorbutic. Hence its common name ‘Cooks scurvy
  grass’. See text below.<br>During his voyages of exploration, James Cook collected
  a number of plant species at various locations which were used to help ward off
  scurvy amongst his crew. While visiting Tolaga Bay in New Zealand on his first voyage,
  Cook noted in his journal on 27 October 1769: "...the other place I landed at was
  the north point of the Bay where I got as much Sellery and Scurvy grass as loaded
  the Boat". Historian John Cawte Beaglehole believed that "Scurvy grass" in this
  case referred to Lepidium oleraceum. Specimens of the plant were collected by botanists
  Johann and George Forster on Cook''s second voyage.<br><br>For more details about
