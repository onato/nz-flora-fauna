description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Leptinella rotundifolia is a tight interesting
  mat-forming plant with small rounded leaves reaching a mature height of 5cm x width
  1m. Sold in nurseries.<br><br>For over 100 years, Leptinella species were considered
  part of the genus Cotula, but the genus Leptinella was reinstated by Lloyd &amp;
  Webb in 1987. They determined that all species of Leptinella are distinguished from
  those of the other two sections of Cotula, and other anthemideae, by the conspicuous
  "inflated" corollas of the female florets and by chromosome numbers based on x =
  26 where known.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0003/4199/Leptinella_rotundifolia-001.JPG"
