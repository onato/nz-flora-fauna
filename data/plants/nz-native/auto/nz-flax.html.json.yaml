description: 'The plant grows as a clump of long, strap like leaves, up to two meters
  long, from which arises a much taller flowering shoot, with dramatic yellow or red
  flowers. The long leaf fibres have played an important role in the culture, history,
  and economy of New Zealand. It has been widely distributed to temperate regions
  of the world as economic fibre and ornamental plant. Phormium tenax is an evergreen
  perennial plant native to New Zealand and Norfolk Island. Harakeke was the name
  given to this plant by Maori. The first European traders called it "flax" because
  its fibres were similar to that of true flax found in other parts of the world.
  Though we still call it flax today harakeke is really a lily and is one of our oldest
  plant species.<br>A flax bush will often support a large community of animals, providing
  shelter and an extensive food resource. Tui, bellbirds, saddlebacks, short tailed
  bats, geckos and several types of insects enjoy nectar from the flax flower. Flax
  snails, a rare land snail living only in the Far North, often shelter under flax
  bushes. These snails don’t eat any part of the flax instead they munch on fallen
  leaves from native broadleaf trees. Many fascinating insects will go through their
  complete lifecycle on a flax plant without causing any harm to this plant.<br>Traditional
  uses of flax No fibre plant was more important to Maori than flax. Each pa or marae
  typically had a pa harakeke or flax plantation. Different varieties were specially
  grown for their strength, softness, colour and fibre content. Traditionally when
  harakeke leaves were removed from the plant, only the older leaves on the outside
  were taken. It is believed the three inner layers of the plant represented a family.
  This outer layer represented the grandparents, whereas the inner layer of new shoots
  or the child remained to be protected by the next inner layer of leaves, the parents.
  The uses of the flax fibre were numerous and varied. Clothing, mats, plates to eat
  off, baskets, ropes, bird snares, lashings, fishing lines and nets were all made
  from flax. Babies were even given rattles made from flax. Other parts of the plant
  were also used. Floats or rafts were made out of bundles of dried flower stalks
  (kokari). The abundant nectar from flax flowers was used to sweeten food and beverages.<br>Flax
  also had many medicinal uses. The sticky sap or gum that flax produces was applied
  to boils and wounds and used for toothache. Flax leaves were used in binding broken
  bones and matted leaves were used as dressings. Flax root juice was routinely applied
  to wounds as a disinfectant. Today, flax is used in soaps, hand crèmes, shampoos
  and a range of other cosmetics. Flax seed oil can also be found for sale.<br><br>Photographed
