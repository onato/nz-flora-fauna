  native to the subantarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands of New Zealand and Australiaâ€™s
  Macquarie Island. It grows up to 900 mm in height and has crimson button flowers
  and long, silky, silver leaves, with a large carrot-like tuber and long roots. It
  also has the unusual feature of a vertically contractile stem, most of which is
  underground, which serves to keep the leaf rosette close to the ground surface and
  the plant anchored securely against the very strong winds typical of subantarctic
  islands. <br>It flowers during December-February and seeds January-May. Seeds spread
  by wind.<br>Pleurophyllum hookeriis is threatened on Macquarie Island by introduced
  black rats and European rabbits.<br><br>The yellow flowers in the background are
