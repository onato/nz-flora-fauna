  is a Raoula that is thought to be a previously undescribed species, but as yet there
  is not enough information to complete a formal description.<br>Raoulia aff. hookeri
  ''Coast'' is a rare declining mat daisy found in New Zealand''s coastal ecosystems.
  Its habitat is shingle beaches which are a mixture of sand, water-smoothed gravel
  and cobbles. These beaches occur where rivers have delivered large quantities of
  shingle to the coast or where nearby coastal cliffs containing gravel are being
  eroded. It is a prostrate evergreen perennial with tiny spoon-shaped leaves that
  are covered in a silvery tomentum.<br><br>Photographed at Otari Wilton Reserve,
