description: 'Raoulia tenuicaulis is the most common species of the Raoulia. It is
  found from the lowland to low-alpine areas from Auckland south. It occupies more
  than one latitudinal zone on Mt. Egmont/Taranaki and can be found along the course
  of the Stony River below Bells Falls to the park boundary. <br>This species forms
  a bright-green flat mat, roughly circular or ellipsoid, compact in the centre, but
  very loose and open at the margin. Its mats, perhaps 1 m. in diameter but later
  on they frequently run together so that large patches, 25 square metres in area,
  become covered with this plant. The surface is rough; it has a “bristly” appearance,
  owing to the numerous acute leaves, but owing to the laxness of growth and the flexibility
  of the leaves and stems the general “feel” of the mat is soft. <br>The main stems
  are prostrate, closely appressed to the ground and above give off secondary branches,
  but below root copiously. They are wiry, thin (main stem 2 mm. diameter, ultimate
  branchlets 0.5 mm. diameter), and brownish or blackish in colour.<br><br> Photographed
