name: Sarcocornia quinqueflora
description: 'Sarcocornia quinqueflora is a common species of perennial, succulent,
  halophytic, coastal plant. It occurs in coastal areas of Australia and New Zealand.
  In New Zealand, it''s found mostly in marsh estuarine areas and on coastal rock
  platforms. It is found throughout the North Island. In the South Island, it is widespread
  on the East and the Northcoast but isn''t found down the west coast.<br>It can form
  large colonies of greyish succulent stems up to 10-30cm long. The stems are completely
  covered in pairs of translucent leaves which are fused together forming a collar
  with two-minute lobes. They can be green or tinged with red. The basal parts of
  the plant are woody and prostate. <br>Throughout summer and autumn, small flowers
  are produced on the upper parts of the branchlets. The flowers are inconspicuous
  and are contained in false whorl-like rings within 1-5 cm long and 3-5 mm wide succulent
  spikes at the ends of branches. Flowers are in single rows of 10-18 per false whorl
  and often only noticeable when their yellow anthers or white stigmas protrude.<br><br>The
  erect soft upper parts have an unusual salty flavour and are used in salads.</p>
  <p>This photo shows how this plant lives in contact with seawater. Notice the three
  mangrove seeds germinating and the bubble seaweed. <br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0010/2868/Glasswort__Sarcocornia_quinqueflora__.jpg"
