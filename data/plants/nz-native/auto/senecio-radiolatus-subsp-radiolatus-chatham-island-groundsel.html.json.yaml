description: 'Senecio radiolatus subsp. radiolatus is an annual or short-lived plant
  found in coastal and dune sites on the Chatham Islands. It is often associated with
  the nesting sites of seabirds, especially the Chatham Island mollymawk (Diomedea
  cauta eremita. <br>This groundsel is at risk due to loss of its habitat, loss of
  seabird colonies and browsing by introduced animals.<br>It is an erect or straggling
  plant with grey-green to dark green, fleshy, erect leaves. Yellow daisy-like flowers
  with yellow centres appear during October to May above the plant as compound cyme.<br><br><a
