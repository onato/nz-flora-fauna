description: 'Stilbocarpa lyallii is a large-leaved, perennial, flowering, endemic,
  native, megaherb found only on the Titi Islands (Breaksea Islands) which are a southern
  chain of islands chain that lies to the south-west of Stewart Island, New Zealand.
  It has now been introduced Te Puka-Hereka (Coal Island) situated in Preservation
  Inlet (part of Fiordland) and to Ulva Island in the Paterson Inlet, Stewart Island.<br><br>Stilbocarpa
  lyallii grows to about 0.2 m high on hollow stems that are &gt;1.5 cm in diameter.
  <br>The plants have large, vivid green, kidney-shaped leaves are &gt;30 cm. or wider.
  They have serrate margins with the teeth ending in a sharp point. Both surfaces
  of the leaves have prominent veins. <br>The brown/reddish, 5 petaled flowers are
  arranged in compound umbels. They are hermaphrodite (having both male and female
  organs). The globular, black shiny seeds are 3•5 mm in diameter.<br><br>During historical
  times temporary flutes were made from the hollow stems by Māori while taking a break
  from the muttonbirding. The Māori mutton birders when returning to the mainland
  used to bring back bundles of it to eat as a cabbage. The large leaves were also
  used to wrap food before placing it in an umu (oven in the ground).<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0012/2468/1-Stibopcarpa_lyalli.jpg"
