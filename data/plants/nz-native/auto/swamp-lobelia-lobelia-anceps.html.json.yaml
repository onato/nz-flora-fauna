description: 'Lobelia anceps is a very widespread species, not only in New Zealand
  and the Kermadec/3 Kings/Chatham Islands but also it occurs in Australia and southern
  Africa as well and it has become naturalized in Brazil. It was collected by Joseph
  Banks in New Zealand in October 1769. The genus name Lobelia commemorates Matthias
  de l''Obel, a Flemish nobleman (1538–1616) who was a botanist and physician to James
  I of England. The specific name anceps is derived from a word meaning two-edged;
  flattened.<br>Lobelia anceps is a small low prostrate to ascending sparsely branched
  perennial sprawling plant that will ramble near the ground and some of the branches
  can become erect and may reach a height of 1 metre, even taller if growing up through
  other vegetation. Erect stems have 3 very narrow wings along their length while
  the prostrate ones only have 2. Plants may be smooth or softly hairy. <br>The soft,
  toothed leaves are narrow to spoon-shaped and broader towards the base. They range
  from 1–5 mm wide and 6cm long.<br>It mainly flowers in the warmer months (September
  to May but sporadic flowering may also occur at other times. The small flowers are
  blue/blue-purple/white. They occur in the axils of the upper leaves. The corolla
  tube is split to the base between the upper 2 petals which are tiny and stand upright
  while the lower 3 are much larger, forming a fan shape. The stamens are shorter
  than the corolla tube and the lower 2 anthers have a brush-like tuft of white hairs
  at their tips. The fruit is a capsule containing a number of small seeds.<br>Lobelia
  anceps grows in sun or shade but requires a moist soil in exposed situations, so
  is usually encountered around seepage areas, wet or boggy areas, swamps, lakes,
  streams, etc.<br><br>Photographed at <a href="http://www.tekaingamarire.co.nz/"
