name: Mazus novae-zelandiae
description: This Mazus is found in lowland to lower montane swamp margins, boggy
  ground. Since it is normally found in damp ground but as our swamps have been drain
  over the years it has become quite rare. It is a low perennial herb forming rosettes
  connected by rhizomes, glabrous or with scattered to Â± dense non-glandular hairs
  at least on leaves and rachis. The flowers are small and white.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Photographed
