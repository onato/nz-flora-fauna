  alt="" width="100%" height="auto"> The tree nettle is one of New Zealand''s most
  poisonous native plants due to its stinging action. See last paragraph below.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Urtica ferox is a nettle that is endemic to New Zealand. Sometimes
  have woody stems and unusually large stinging spines, and can grow 5 metres tall.
  Even the lightest touch can result in a painful sting that lasts several days. <br>There
  has been one recorded human death from contact—a lightly clad hunter who died five
  hours after walking through a dense patch. Acute polyneuropathy can occur due to
  U. ferox stings. Polyneuropathy is a neurological disorder that occurs when many
  nerves throughout the body malfunction simultaneously.<br>In Maori folklore, Kupe
  was said to have placed several obstacles to hinder pursuers whose wives he had
  stolen, one of which was the Urtica ferox.<br>Urtica ferox is a dioecious plant
  with pale green leaves which are arranged opposite each other. Their shape is ovate-triangular
  to lanceolate-triangular with pointed ends. The edges are deeply and coarsely toothed.
  The teeth can be up to one centimetre long. The leaves are about eight to twelve
  centimetres long and three to five centimetres wide. Stipules grow at each leaf
  axis, which is like small leaves without a stalk.<br>The veins, edges and stalks
  of the leaves, as well as the branches and flowers, are covered in numerous stiff
  stinging hairs. The stinging hairs are about six millimetres long and have sharp
  pointed ends. When touched the stinging hairs break and release a toxic substance
  which causes a prickling-burning sensation.<br>Urtica ferox has during November
  to March small pale greenish flowers which grow together on spikes up to eight centimetres
  long and are coming from the leaf axis. Pollination happens through the wind.<br>The
  fruits develop and ripen between December and May and are a one and a half millimetre
  long ovoid, brown nut.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Urtica ferox grows on the North
  and South Island of New Zealand as well as on Stewart Island. The tree nettle is
  in temperate bush in lowland areas, which includes stock-damaged bush, scrubland
  and forest margins. This plant can resist temperatures down to minus eight degree
  Celsius. In colder areas, it will drop its leaves during winter.<br><br>Urtica ferox
  is the main food plant for larvae of the New Zealand Red Admiral butterfly Bassaris
  gonerilla and The Yellow Admiral butterfly (Vanessa itea)<br><br>The tree nettle
  is one of New Zealand''s most poisonous native plants. Standing about two metres
  tall, it’s coarsely toothed leaves have numerous white stinging hairs (trichomes),
  up to 6mm long, at the tip of each tooth as well as on young stalks and leaf veins.
  These are hollow cylinders with tapered points, which break after piercing the skin,
  injecting toxins into the tissues, giving rise to pain and rash. There have been
  cases of dogs and horses developing neurological problems, with respiratory distress
  and convulsions within minutes of exposure, often dying within hours, although some
  do recover. There are also reports of human poisoning in botanical references or
  the press. Connor, in his book, The Poisonous Plants in New Zealand, mentions a
  group of trampers who developed loss of coordination for three days after being
  stung. In another instance, a typist developed tingling numbness in the hand after
  grasping a nettle bush, preventing her from typing for five days. There are also
  reports of severe headaches, blurred vision and extreme fatigue. A fatal poisoning
  was described in 1961 when a young man died of paralysis and respiratory problems
  several hours after walking through a patch of tree nettles. The above text thanks
