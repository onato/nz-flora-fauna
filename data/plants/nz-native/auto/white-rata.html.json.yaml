description: ' <br>Common names. Climbing white rata, Akatea. Aka, Clinging rata,
  Small white rata, Akatorotoro<br><br>Metrosideros perforata is one of twelve Metrosideros
  species endemic to New Zealand. <br>Metrosideros perforata is a climber growing
  up 15 m high and can have a stem 15cm or more in diameter. It can be in a form of
  a bushy shrub when a tree is not available to climb. <br>The leathery green oval
  opposite leaves are 0.8â€“1.2 cm long, the leaves when young tend to lie in one plane
  and. The leaves have conspicuous oil glands on the underside. The young shoots are
  covered with soft matted hairs. The bark is reddish-brown and stringy.<br>In mid-summer,
  it has masses of white flowers from white buds. The small white flowers are carried
  in small clusters and are very attractive to bees, butterflies, birds, geckos and
  at night time the white flowers attract many species of moths. <br>Metrosideros
  perforata is found in coastal to lowland forests and forest edges, North Island,
  South Island and Three Kings Island, New Zealand.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">The information
  below is of its use by Maori and it is from the website. <br><a href="http://www.o2landscapes.com/pages/pp-metrosideros.php">http://www.o2landscapes.com/pages/pp-metrosideros.php</a><br>Metrosideros
  perforata had a valuable practical purpose for Maori, as it was one of the primary
  species utilised for lashing (of weapons as well as palisades). The thin young stems
  were tied in a green state, when they were still pliable and subsequently dried
  to become very hard and rigid3. The large cables that form on very old rata vines
  were also used by Maori as a means of ascending cliffs - a practice that is adapted
  in the myth of Tawhaki, a warrior who ascended to the heavens on a giant ''aka''
  cable (to bring back his wife and child, in one telling).<br><br>A Metrosideros
