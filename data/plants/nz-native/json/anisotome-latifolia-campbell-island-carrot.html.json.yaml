description: 'Anisotome latifolia is a member of the carrot family and they are only
  found in New Zealand’s subantarctic, including Auckland, Campbell, Antipodes, Snares
  and Macquarie Islands. It occurs from the coast up to the tops of the island ranges
  on the peaty ground between tussocks and other megaherbs, though more rarely under
  low forest. It is most abundant at lower altitudes and where the vegetation is not
  subject to browsing by introduced animals.<br>Anisotome latifolia is a large and
  robust perennial herb, growing up to 2 m in height. <br>The hairless, leathery basal
  leaves are 300–600 mm long and 100–200 mm wide, 2-pinnate with 5-7 pairs of dark
  to yellow-green leaflets. The margins are toothed.<br>The inflorescence axis grows
  up to 2 m, with a 10–15 mm diameter at the first node. The flowers vary from off-white
  to a creamy pink in colour. The plant flowers from October to February and fruits
  from January to March.<br>One of Anisotome latifolia main pollinators is the nocturnal
  Sub Antarctic weta (Notoplectron campbellensis).<br><br>Anisotome latifolia on Enderby
