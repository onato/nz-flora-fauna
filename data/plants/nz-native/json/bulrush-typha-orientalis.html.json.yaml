description: 'Typha orientalis is a vigorous erect clump-forming perennial aquatic
  plant with spreading rhizomes. It is found throughout New Zealand in shallow fertile
  waters of sheltered lakes and swamps and marshes with an underground stem (rhizome).<br>The
  leaves are long strap-shaped basal pale green in colour. It is the seed heads that
  immediately identify this plant. In spring to early summer an erect spike is formed
  bearing tightly packed clusters of single-sex flowers, the male above the female.
  After pollen release, the spike bearing the male flowers withers and the female
  flowers give rise to tiny fruits. Numerous silky hairs (''down'') become packed
  around each fruit to produce the familiar furry brown, cylindrical seed heads. Raupo
  dies down in the winter<br><br>The Maori used the long narrow leaves as a bandage
  around wounds and broken bones. The down that develops as the seeds ripen was also
  used to provide a protective covering for open wounds.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">A
  gruel made from the rhizome was used to feed invalids. The roasted rhizome is also
  a strong laxative. An infusion made from the rhizomes of harakeke (Phormium tenax),
  tataramoa (Rubus sp) and raupo was used to assist the removal of the afterbirth.
  It was also used as a food plant.<br><br><img src="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0010/4723/Raupo__Typha_orientalis_-002.JPG"
