  native broom endemic only to Kaitorete Spit, Canterbury, New Zealand. Its habitat
  is gravelly sandy loam, stabilised sand dunes, and ridges of sand developed along
  the Kaitorete Spit. It grows to a height of 0.3m and has a spread of 0.5m. During
  October - January It has dense scented white flowers with purple streaks.<br>The

  a scientific reserve. For the time being the species seems secure.<br><br>For more
