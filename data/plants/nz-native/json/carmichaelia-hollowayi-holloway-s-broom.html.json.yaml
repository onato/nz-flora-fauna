description: 'Carmichaelia hollowayi is a critically endangered broom whose natural
  habitat is the limestone outcrops on the south side of the Waitaki River on the
  dry eastern flank of the South Island.<br>It is a dwarf, suckering broom growing
  up to 0.5 x 1(-2) m. and has thick branches (which have rounded tops).<br>The flowers
  are distally tinged purple or are otherwise white or purple-veined. They appear
  from November until late summer.<br>With just about only 250 mature plants left
  in the wild, Carmichaelia hollowayi suffers from a lack of young plants to replace
  existing populations. This is due to the effect of browsing animals, such as rabbits.<br><br>C.
  hollowayi species name commemorates Rev. J. Holloway, who lectured in botany at
  Otago University.<br><br>For more details visit: <a href="http://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.aspx?ID=7"
