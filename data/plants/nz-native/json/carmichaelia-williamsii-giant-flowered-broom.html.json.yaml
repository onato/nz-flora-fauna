name: Carmichaelia williamsii
description: 'Carmichaelia williamsii is a strictly coastal species of broom growing
  &gt;2 m. It is endemic to the North Island where it is known mainly from the Poor
  Knights and Alderman Islands. On the mainland, it is now known from only two small
  coastal areas near East Cape. Though it is rare in the wild it is sold by specialised
  nurseries. Its habit is open forest, scrub, cliff faces.<br>This robust coastal
  shrub has erect leafless wide flattened yellow-green, green to dark green branches
  (&gt;15mm wide) with wavy edges. These branches are photosynthetic and serve as
  leaves. These wide branches distinguished it from the commonly introduced broom
  (Cytisus scoparius).<br>Flowering occurs usually between July and October. The flowers
  are pea-like and vary slightly in colour from yellow to white and sometimes striped
  with purple or red veins. The seed pod is a dry flattened pod containing 5-15 hard
  orange and black seeds. These seeds are possibly dispersed by wind and granivory.<br><br>For

  vexellum or banner an encloses and protects the other petals as the flower develops.
  The two lateral winged petals called alae. The two lower petals are fused along
  the purple line and are called a keel or carina. This is fusion is common in many
  members of the pea family.<a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4em;" href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0008/2288/Carmichaelia_williamsii__Giant_flowered_broom_-008.JPG"><img
