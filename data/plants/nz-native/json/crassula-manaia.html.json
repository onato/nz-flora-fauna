  "description": "</p> <p>Crassula manaia a nationally vulnerable regionally, endemic, minute annual to short-lived perennial herb confined to the south Taranaki coast. It is extremely vulnerable to habitat loss through the spread of taller, faster-growing weeds. Its habitat is coastal turf and associated fine silts and gravels. It is often found mixed through the grass Zoysia minima.<br>Crassula manaia forms moss like diffuse to dense, compact mats. The stems are very fine and they root at nodes.<br>The succulent leaves are fused at the base. They are 1-2(-3.5) x 0.6-1 mm, 0.5-0.6 mm thick, elliptic-lanceolate to elliptic-ovate, flat above, convex beneath, apex obtuse to subacute.<br>The plant's tiny, pink, reddish or greenish-white flowers (&gt;1.3 mm dia.) are solitary on the leaf axils and may be found throughout the year. <br><br><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0012/2648/1-Crassula-manaia-001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><br></p> <p>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information: <a style=\"font-size: 1em;\" href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
