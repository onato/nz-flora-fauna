description: 'Fuchsia procumbens ''Variegata'', an irregularly variegated cultivar
  of a prostrate multi-branched deciduous shrub native to northern New Zealand. Its
  small flowers are attractive and brighter than those of the species, with longer
  sepals. Height: 0.15m; Spread: 2m. This forms leaves are mottled green and white.
  <br>It will develop roots on branches in contact with soil. The size of the leaves
  varies according to the amount of light the plant is getting - smaller where light
  levels are high.<br>The Fuchsia procumbens small, numerous flowers are unique among
  fuchsias because the tube is yellow. The sepals are green with a purple tip folded
  down against the tube, and the pollen is blue. When fertilised, they turn red and
  are eventually replaced by a plum-like red fruit that is disproportionately large
  considering the size of the leaves and flowers.<br><br>Fuchsia procumbens variegata
