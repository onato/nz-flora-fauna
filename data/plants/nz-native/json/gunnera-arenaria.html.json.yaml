name: Gunnera arenaria
description: '</p> <p>Gunnera arenaria is native coastal species plant found in damp
  sandy areas on dunes and tidal river margins. It also grows on coastal sandstone
  bluffs in some parts of the country. It is endemic to the North, South and Stewart
  Islands of New Zealand from the Pouto Peninsula south and it is mainly westerly
  in its distribution. This plant is at risk from coastal development, wetland drainage
  and the spread of invasive weeds. It flowers and fruits November to March.<br>This
  genus was named after the Norwegian botanist Johann Ernst Gunnerus and the species
  name arenaria means sand dweller.</p> <p>Photographed at Te Kainga Marire Gardens
