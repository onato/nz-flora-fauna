description: 'Leptinella filiformis is a native perennial herb that was originally
  recorded from the upper Awatere, Hanmer Plain, and adjacent Balmoral forest. It
  is now apparently extinct in the wild at all these locations. Once believed extinct
  this species was rediscovered in 1998 in a lawn at Hanmer Springs where by late
  1999 they were extinct due to the redevelopment of the hotel grounds. All cultivated
  material is now known stems from that discovery. It has been reintroduced to protected
  sites but it still remains very uncommon and vulnerable to lose. <br>It was a species
  of lowland to montane basins, plains and valley floors (300-600m altitude) where
  it formed a diffuse turf of feathery green to bronze-green foliage. Small white
  flower heads appear in profusion mainly during summer. Available from specialised
  native nurseries.<br><br>For more detailed information: <a href="http://nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.asp?ID=21"

  100 years, Leptinella species were considered part of the genus Cotula, but the
  genus Leptinella was reinstated by Lloyd &amp; Webb in 1987. They determined that
  all species of Leptinella are distinguished from those of the other two sections
  of Cotula, and other anthemideae, by the conspicuous "inflated" corollas of the
  female florets and by chromosome numbers based on x = 26 where known.<br><br>A carpet
