description: 'Lilaeopsis novae-zelandiae is a New Zealand coastal grass like salt
  tolerant plant associated with brackish habitats as it is not fussy about water
  quality or light. It grows throughout New Zealand in brackish areas like the margins
  of Lake Ellesmere, Waimamaku River estuary, a small pond in the sand hills near
  Riverton and is also found on the Chatham Islands. This small spear shaped grass-like
  plant with sometimes a tangled mass of foliage grows up to 10cm tall and is used
  as ground cover at the front of aquariums. It reproduces vegetatively from runners
  or by rhizomes.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0003/9229/Lilaeopsis_novae-zelandiae__Zelandiae_chain_sword_.JPG"
