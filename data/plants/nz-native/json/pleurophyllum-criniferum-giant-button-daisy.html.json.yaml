name: Pleurophyllum criniferum
description: 'Pleurophyllum criniferum is a species of flowering, herbaceous plant
  in the daisy family. It is endemic to New Zealand’s subantarctic Islands of Auckland,
  Campbell and Antipodes. It occurs from the coast up into the island ranges on peaty
  ground in herbfields.<br>Pleurophyllum criniferum is a large perennial herb, growing
  up to 2 m in height. The thin, shallow ribbed leaves may grow to a metre or more
  in length and are diverse in shape, though usually oblong-ovate to lanceolate. The
  undersides are covered by silky white hairs. The leaves are arranged singly along
  the stem. Because of the unusual size of the leaves, such plants are commonly referred
  to as megaherbs. <br>The flowers occur as 15–30 heads in elongated racemes with
  short and inconspicuous ray-florets and dark purple disk-florets. The plant flowers
  from December to February and it seeds from January to May.<br><br>The flowers of
  Pleurophyllum criniferum are a deep purple whilst Pleurophyllum hookeri flowers
  are crimson.<br> Natural hybrids between these species have been recorded.<br><br>Photographed
  from the Col Lyall Boardwalk (180m) on Campbell Island . Pleurophyllum criniferum
  is flowering; the adjacent plants are Bulbinella rossii. <br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0012/5123/1-Pleurophyllum_criniferum_.jpg"
