  "description": "Raoulia is a genus endemic to New Zealand. Raoulia aff. hookeri 'Coast' is a Raoula that is thought to be a previously undescribed species, but as yet there is not enough information to complete a formal description.<br>Raoulia aff. hookeri 'Coast' is a rare declining mat daisy found in New Zealand's coastal ecosystems. Its habitat is shingle beaches which are a mixture of sand, water-smoothed gravel and cobbles. These beaches occur where rivers have delivered large quantities of shingle to the coast or where nearby coastal cliffs containing gravel are being eroded. It is a prostrate evergreen perennial with tiny spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery tomentum.<br><br>Photographed at Otari Wilton Reserve, Wellington.<br><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0009/3548/Raoulia_aff._hookeri__Coast_._hookeri__Coast_-002.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"> <br><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a><br></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
