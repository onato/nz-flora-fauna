  "description": "Rubus squarrosus is a native vine which can reach a height of 3m and with a similar spread. It is an intriguing leafless vine with conspicuous bright yellow thorns along its stems creating a skeletal look.<br>Rubus squarrosus is perhaps the most remarkable of the genus Rubus, as, in open situations and on shrubs, the leaflet blades remain undeveloped and the leaves consist of rather elongated petioles and the almost threadlike midribs of the leaflets, all beset with yellow prickles. Such leaves are very effective in clinging to any support. When the stems reach into tree crowns there is a trend towards normal leaves with well-formed narrow leaflets. <br>It is endemic to North and South Islands, from Ahipara south but is rare north of the Manawatu.<br><br>A thorny tangled mass.<br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0005/3489/Rubus_squarrosus__leafless_lawyer-002.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0005/3489/Rubus_squarrosus__leafless_lawyer-002.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a><br></p> <p>Undeveloped leaflet blades with yellow prickles on the stems which stand out prominently because of the paucity of leaves. <br><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0005/3494/Rubus_squarrosus__leafless_lawyer-003.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><br><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
