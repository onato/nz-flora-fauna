name: Scutellaria novae-zelandiae
description: 'Scutellaria novae-zelandiae is one of two members of the mint family
  native to New Zealand. It is a rare soft woody herb with erect branches up to 30
  cm tall with creeping stems that root at the nodes in the surface topsoil.<br>The
  main stems woody at base, creeping, square in cross-section, dark purple-red, maroon
  to almost black. <br>It has small, dark green, oval leaves which are typically 4–5
  mm long and 2–4 mm across. The softly hairy white flowers are up to 5 mm across
  and appear August to March (sporadic flowering may occur throughout the year).<br><br>It
  is endemic to the lowland forests in Nelson and Marlborough, South Island, New Zealand.
  It was listed among the rare and endangered plants of New Zealand by Given (1981)
  because of the very few collections and absence of information on its ecology and
  has received a rating of ''Endangered'' according to the IUCN classification (Wilson
  and Given, 1989).<br><br>Scutellaria was first recorded from Nelson in 1840 and
  has been found only at scattered lowland sites since then, from Golden Bay to the
  Awatere Valley in Marlborough. Most of these sites occur in the Golden Bay and Arthur
  Ecological Districts (McEwen, 1987) of the North-West Nelson Ecological Region,
  the Moutere and Bryant Districts of the Nelson Region, and the Pelorus District
  of the Richmond Region. Many of these populations had not been relocated since the
  1950s, and until recently Scutellaria was known from only one location near Takaka
  and several sites in the Maitai and Roding valleys near Nelson (Wilson and Given,
  1989). There have been no studies of Scutellaria, although it has been grown in
  nurseries for a number of years. <br>Acknowledgements P. A. Williams, published
