name: Tetragonia tetragonioides
description: '</p> <p>Tetragonia tetragonioides is a leafy groundcover and it is native
  to New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Chile and Argentine New Zealand it is indigenous
  to the Kermadec, Three Kings, North, South, Stewart and Chatham Islands. Its habitat
  is the coastal strand zone often growing along beaches amongst driftwood but it
  is also in sand dunes, on boulder and cobble beaches, on cliff faces and rock ledges.
  Nowadays because it is cultivated it often appears in landfills or as a casual weed
  of urban areas. The plant is a halophyte (a plant that grows in waters of high salinity)<br>The
  species was rarely used by Māori as a leaf vegetable and was first mentioned by
  Captain Cook. It was picked, cooked, and pickled to help fight scurvy, and taken
  with the crew of the Endeavour. It spread when the explorer and botanist Joseph
  Banks took seeds back to Kew Gardens during the latter half of the 18th century.
  For two centuries, T. tetragonioides was the only cultivated vegetable to have originated
  from Australia and New Zealand.<br>The species prefers a moist environment for growth.
  The plant has a trailing habit and will form a thick carpet on the ground or climb
  through other vegetation and hang downwards. The leaves of the plant are 3–15 cm
  long, triangular in shape, and bright green. The leaves are thick and covered with
  tiny papillae that look like water drops on the top and bottom of the leaves. The
  flowers of the plant are yellow, and the fruit is a small, hard pod covered with
  small horns. <br><br>For more detail information visit: <a href="http://nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.aspx?ID=325"
