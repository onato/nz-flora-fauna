name: Dactylanthus taylorii
description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Dactylanthus taylorii is New Zealand’s only
  fully parasitic plant. It grows on the roots of about 30 species of trees in New
  Zealand. In Egmont National Park the tree hosts are partly a reflection of what
  is available within the vegetation zone in which the Dactylanthus occur and include
  toro (Myrsine salicina), broadleaf (Griselinia littoralis), mountain horopito (Pseudowintera
  colorata), kamahi (Weinmannia racemosa) and others.<br>It is the only species in
  the Dactylanthus genus and occurs only in New Zealand.<br>It is a root parasite
  with no green leaves growing completely or partially under the ground. It is completely
  dependent on its host plant for food and water.<br>The host tree responds to the
  presence of Dactylanthus by forming a burl-like structure that resembles a fluted
  wooden rose (hence the common name).<br>Plants are either male or female. They flower
  between January and April.<br>Fruits about 2 mm long are produced from February
  to May. The plant has no green leaves, and roots are also absent, the plant being
  connected to the host by its stem.<br>The short-tailed bat is an excellent pollinator
  of Dactylanthus taylorii. They are attracted by the sweet smelling nectar of the
  flowers.<br>Some plants have been aged in excess of 30 years old. It prefers damp
  but not waterlogged soil and is often found at the head of small streams. It tends
  to live under the dense canopies of tall trees but some specimens may be found at
  forest borders.<br>The plant is cryptic, and hence hard to survey, but there are
  unlikely to be more than a few thousand in existence. Most of these are in the North
  Island. It is likely that many sites are known only to collectors, as the woody
  growth has commercial value.<br>The wood rose is under threat from harvesting by
  collectors, browsing by possums, rats, pigs and deer, habitat loss, and the rarity
  of its pollinators and seed dispersers.<br>Dactylanthus is regarded, as of 2004,
  as a ''Category A'' threatened species. The New Zealand Department of Conservation
  started a recovery plan in 1995. Protection measures include pest control and enclosure
  of the plants in cages.<br>It is currently only known in the North Island in an
  area approximately bounded by Hamilton, East Cape, Napier, Mangaweka and Taranaki.
  It is also present on Great Barrier Island.<br><br><img src="uploads/images/Te%20Henui/sound%20icon.jpg"
