description: >
  Alectryon excelsus subsp. grandis is a small spreading multitrunked
  shrub (4 x 4 m) with large leaves and its endemic to the Three Kings Islands, where
  it is known from Great and West Islands. It often grows along the more exposed forest
  margins and is occasionally found as a subcanopy tree within the dense kanuka (Kunzea
  aff. ericoides) forest that dominates the Three Kings Islands. It is a smaller tree
  than the mainland Titoki (Alectryon excelsus). Red / Pink flowers which are bisexual
  (have both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) reproductive units) or staminate
  (having stamens but no pistils) are produced from October to December. From December
  to April scarlet fruit with a black seed develops. This shrub is now sold in
  specialised nurseries.
