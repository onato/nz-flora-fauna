name: Beilschmiedia tarairi
description: 'Beilschmiedia tarairi is a common canopy forming native tree that grows
  in lowland and lower montane forests in the NorthIsland north of 38°S latitude.
  There are scattered populations on the west coast between Port Waikato and the KawhiaHarbour,
  and inland in the Waikato basin. On the east, it occurs in scattered locations on
  the East Cape. It often grows with kauri (Agathis australis), and pohutukawa (Metrosideros
  excelsa), and puriri (Vitex lucens).</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Beilschmiedia tarairi
  grows up to 22 m in height and has a very wide crown. Its trunk may be up to 1 m
  in diameter with smooth bark that is dark brown colour. The branches are stout and
  tend to spread widely. <br>It has broad, glossy, dark-green, bullate leaves (50
  and 72 mm long, and 34 to 48 mm wide) with a distinctive glaucous underside. Older
  leaves are shiny dark green above and dull blue-green below, with red-brown hairs
  along the underside veins. They are alternate, leathery, and simple, with distinctive,
  depressed veins. They are covered in bronze tomentum when young but lose most of
  this as they mature. <br>The greenish-brown flowers appear September and December
  and are 3–5 mm in diameter and often clothed in dense reddish-brown hairs.<br>The
  ripe, fleshy, olive-shaped, dark purple fruits are covered in a waxy glaucous bloom.
  They held upright near the tips of its branches. They ripen between March and November.
  The fruit''s seeds are spread by frugivore dispersal. They are a favourite food
  of the native New Zealand kererū (New Zealand pigeon).</p> <p class="MsoNormal">There
  are no records of the Maori having used Beilschmiedia tarairi for medicinal purposes
  but the berries were eaten after the kernel was roasting or boiled.<br>The Maori
  and the early Europeans had little use of taraire wood because it was light and
  because it split easily and it was quick to rot. Use of Beilschmiedia tarairi for
  timber only started with the advent of boron diffusion treatment. It was used for
  flooring, furniture, mouldings and turning on a lathe.<br>It was reported by <a

  fires for hollowing out logs for canoes.<br><br>The thick branches of an adult tree<a
