description: 'The cabbage tree is a familiar sight in swamps or dampish places throughout
  New Zealand vegetation. It reaches heights of 20 mt and has trunks with diameters
  of up to a 1.5 m plus. The crown is made up of long, bare branches carrying bushy
  heads of large, grass-like leaves up to a meter long.<br>Early settlers used the
  young leaves from the centre of these heads as a substitute for cabbage – hence
  the common name. <br>At the flowering time which is during late November to February
  large panicles of small, white, sweet-scented flowers emerge from the centre of
  the heads. Good flowering seasons only occur every few years. Small, whitish berries
  are formed which are readily eaten by birds. The tree is very tenacious of life,
  and chips of the wood or sections of the stem will readily shoot.<br>The genus Cordyline
  is placed by many botanists in the lily family, a group of plants which contains
  few trees, C. australis being the largest. The genus contains over twenty species
  most of which occur in the warm temperate and tropical regions of the southern hemisphere.
  Apart from the cabbage tree, there are four other species in New Zealand and the
  surrounding islands.<br>The Maoris obtained a most nutritious food, kauru, from
  the root of the young cabbage tree. This root is an extension of the trunk below
  the surface of the ground and is shaped like an enormous carrot some 2–3 ft long.
  An observer of the early 1840s, Edward Shortland, noted that the Maoris “prefer
  those grown in deep rich soil; they have learned to dig it at the season when it
  contains the greatest quantity of saccharine matter; that is, just before the flowering
  of the plant. They then bake; or rather steam it in their ovens. On cooling, the
  sugar is partially crystallised, and is found mixed with other matter between the
  fibres of the root, which are easily separated by tearing them asunder, and are
  then dipped in water and chewed”. The trunk of the cabbage tree is so fire-resistant
  that early European settlers used it to make chimneys for their huts. They also
  brewed beer from the root.<br><br>Medical Uses: An infusion of the leaves was used
  for dysentery and diarrhoea and for cuts. (From "Maori medical lore" by W. H. Goldie.
  1905) The leaves were softened by rubbing and scraping. These scrapings were applied
  as an ointment to cuts, cracks in the skin and sores (from unpublished notes by
  Beryl Moore 1940). The younger inner shoots and the top of the stem were boiled
  and eaten by nursing mothers and were given to their children for colic. (From unpublished
  notes by T. Kururangi 1941) <br><br>A stand of Cordyline australis, North Taranaki
