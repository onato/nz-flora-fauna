  sometimes forms large dense flat mats amongst grasslands and in herbfields and rocky
  areas in alpine and subalpine areas. It is an extremely rugged species and will
  survive in extreme places such as the short grasslands of the Mackenzie Basin or
  on the exposed rocky ground in montane areas.<br>It is a dense matting plant with
  rich green leaves but in some extreme conditions, they will exhibit a brownish-green
  colour. It is a wind-pollinated plant and the plants only produce either male or
  female seeds, they are not self-fertilizing.<br><br>Photographed at Otari Wilton
