name: Coprosma rotundifolia
description: 'Coprosma rotundifolia is a native forest shrub of New Zealand. Its found
  on the North Island from about Kaitaia south, South and Stewart Islands in damp
  lowland forests and especially on alluvial soils. It can grow up to 6 metres tall
  with divaricating branches. These wide-angled branches bear pairs of small (15-25mm
  long x 10-20mm wide), rounded leaves that are covered in small hairs. The leaves
  often have purple-blotches on them and they can taper to a small sharp tip. Veins
  are evident on both sides of leaves.<br>The flowers are dioecious (male and female
  flowers are on separate trees). The female flowers are seated in the green calyculus
  which is formed by the fusion of two stipulate bracts. The petals above are joined
  with the 2 female translucent stigmas rising above. They are pollinated by wind.<br>Coprosma
  rotundifolia produces orange or red fruit (4-5 mm in diameter) on very short stalks.
  The fleshy fruits have two seeds and are dispersed by birds. <br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/4954/Coprosma_rotundifolia__Round_leaved_coprosma_-003.JPG"
