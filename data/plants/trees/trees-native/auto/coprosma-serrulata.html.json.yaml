name: Coprosma serrulata
description: 'Coprosma serrulata is an erect to depressed bushy evergreen shrub growing
  to 1m in height and is endemic to montane to lower sub-alpine forests, shrublands
  and grasslands, from latitude 41Â°S southwards of the South Island, New Zealand.
  It is usually found growing amongst other lower growing shrubs and grasses.<br>The
  very thick, leathery, dark green leaves (4-7cm long) have minutely serrate margins
  and reticulated veins which are evident on both surfaces.<br>Coprosma serrulata
  is dioecious (separate male or female plants). The male plants have several flowers
  together on very short axillary peduncles while the female has only one flower per
  axillary peduncle. They are pollinated by the wind. The fruits are red and about
  8mm long.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/6134/Coprosma_serrulata__-004.JPG"
