  '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Cordyline pumilio is the smallest of New Zealand''s
  five native species of Cordyline. The species name pumilio is Latin for "dwarf".
  It is a narrow-leaved monocot shrub endemic to the North Island from Te Paki (North
  Cape) to Kawhia Harbour in the west and Bay of Plenty in the East. Its natural habitat
  is coastal to montane light forests especially along ridgelines and around slip
  scars.

  It usually grows up to 1 metre tall, although rare examples of 2 metres
  tall have been reported. It has with long narrow leaves and can easily be mistaken
  for a grass or sedge. A flower spike or panicle appears in November or December.

  

  It
  was used by the Maori who cultivated by Maori in the Waikato district and elsewhere
  all over New Zealand. It was grown for its sugar-laden roots and stems which were
  used as a relish to sweeten less palatable foods. Young seedlings were carefully
  selected and planted out, and after perhaps three years the roots were dug up, stacked
  in small piles, and dried in the sun. As they dried, the fibrous roots were burned
  off, and then the roots were scraped and baked slowly in a hangi, requiring twelve
  to eighteen hours to cook. The cooked roots were chewed or pounded and washed and
  squeezed to extract the sugar, which was eaten with fern root as a relish.
