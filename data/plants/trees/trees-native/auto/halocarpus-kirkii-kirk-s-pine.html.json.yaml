name: Halocarpus kirkii
description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Halocarpus kirkii is a dioecious lowland forest
  tree endemic to New Zealand. <br>It is not a common tree, sometimes being found
  in lowland forests to an altitude of 700 metres in the north of the North Island
  from Te Paki (Radar and Unuwhao Bush) south to near Limestone Downs (south of Port
  Waikato) in the west and about the southern Kauaeranga Valley in the East including
  the Coromandel Peninsula and Great Barrier Island. Halocarpus kirkii ultimately
  reaches a height of about 25 metres, with a trunk up to 1 metre thick. Lower branches
  are spreading while the upper ones are erect. It has grey-brown bark which is smooth
  on young trees but on old trees, it has rough and pustular texture. It can be usually
  distinguished by its juvenile foliage, which often remains on the lower branches
  until the tree grows to approximately 10 metres tall. <br>The leaves of the younger
  trees and on the lower branches of the adults are narrow and to some extent leathery,
  up to 4 cm long and 3 mm wide. The adult leaves are thick, scale-like and much smaller;
  the leaves overlap and lie appressed to the branchlets in 4 rows.<br><br>Young tree
