description: >
  'Helichrysum dimorphum a riparian shrub that has two forms, a scrambling
  shrub or a liane with stems up to 8m long. The stems are cord-like, flexible, unbranched
  but have many slender branches at their ends. From September to February it produces
  small, insignificant sweet-scented flowers. The shrub can resemble a mass of dead
  stalks.

  It is only found in the South Island and its distribution is the Poulter
  river, the lower Esk river and Waimakariri river in Canterbury. It is usually found
  on river terraces and alongside river gorges.
