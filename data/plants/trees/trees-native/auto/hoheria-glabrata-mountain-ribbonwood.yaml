name: Hoheria glabrata
description: >
  'Hoheria glabrata is found by forest margins and streamsides in the sub-alpine
  zone of the Southern Alps, at altitudes between 2000 and 3500 feet, often forming
  scrub like groves on the upper margins of the forests. It colonises young, deep,
  moist, well-drained and often stony soils such as those provided by slips, talus
  slopes and alluvial fans.

  H. glabrata is an exception among the species Hoheria’
  is that it is the only one found on Mt Taranaki/Egmont. Normally it is to be found
  on the wetter, western, side of the Main Divide while another species H. lyallii
  is found on the drier, eastern, side. H. glabrata is also found on Stewart Island.

  Hoheria
  glabrata is a small tree (&gt;10m) and is one of the few in New Zealand that is
  strongly deciduous. It has attractive yellow to red leaves in the autumn.

  The
  oval leaves are bright green, the edges serrated, and the leaf tip pointed. Juvenile
  leaves have a sparse covering of stellate hairs but become hairless or almost so
  when mature.

  H. glabrata produces masses of beautiful white scented flowers (3.5cm
  across) in summer or autumn, in clusters from the leaf axils. The fruits contain
  10−15 seeds without prominent wings.
