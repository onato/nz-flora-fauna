  'Ileostylus micranthus is an indigenous, epiphytic shrub and it is the
  only member of the genus Ileostylus. It is a primitive, endemic species growing
  on a wide variety of indigenous and exotic hosts (nearly 300) in coastal to lowland
  forest throughout New Zealand including Stewart Islands. Ileostylus micranthus is
  one of the few indigenous mistletoe''s to regularly grow in urban situations. It
  is also found on Norfolk Island.

  

  Ileostylus micranthus is a hemiparasite
  plant, this means it obtains part of its food by parasitism and part by photosynthesises.
  It is a woody, many branched shrub attached to the host by ball-like masses of runners
  with a sucker like haustoria located at intervals along the host branch. It can
  grow to a height of 1 m.

  The variable shaped, ovate to elliptic, leathery, hairless
  leaves are green to yellow-green in colour. They are 20-80mm long and are in opposite
  pairs.

  Flowering occurs during September – December. The green, &gt;5mm diameter,
  4 petaled flowers can be male, female or hermaphroditic.

  One seeded, yellow or
  orange berries appear during December – July.
