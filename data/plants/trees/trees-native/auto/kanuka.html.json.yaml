description: 'Myrtaceae is a large family of trees found throughout tropical and South
  America out of China and down through the Pacific. It includes species such as Pohutukawa,
  Bottlebrush and Kanuka.<br>Kunzea ericoides (Kanuka) varies in size, from a shrub
  to a tree 10 m or more in height, with trunk 60 cm or more in diameter. It is restricted
  to Australia and New Zealand. Kānuka are found throughout New Zealand occurring
  on the Three Kings Islands, Aotea (Great Barrier Island), from Te Paki (on the Aupouri
  Peninsula) at the northern tip of the North Island to as far south as Dunedin and
  Central Otago in the South Island, and the Stewart Island.<br><br>Kanuka''s bark
  is light brown and thicker than the more common manuka (red tea-tree Leptospermum
  scoparium). The wood is white (hence the common name white tea-tree) whereas manuka
  has red timber. <br>The small needle-like leaves of Kanuka and Manuka are very similar.
  Manuka leaves tend to be larger and more aromatic. The easiest way to tell Manuka
  and Kanuka apart is that manuka has larger flowers and large (half cm across) woody
  seed capsules that remain on the tree for a long time. <br>Kanuka flowers are much
  smaller, tend to be in bunches, and the small seed capsules are shed within the
  year. Both trees tend to have white flowers in the wild, but manuka has many coloured
  varieties and is often grown as a garden ornamental. <br><br>In New Zealand Manuka
  and Kanuka are pioneer species, quickly invading an area recently opened by fire,
  grazing or logging. There is little undergrowth in the manuka copse, and the ground
  below it becomes carpeted with dead leaves, almost as in a pine forest. There are,
  perhaps, several reasons for this lack of undergrowth. The plant often grows on
  poor ground; the resinous leaves may, like the pine needles, make a bad mould; and
  the shrub itself probably exhausts the soil. Yet sometimes certain orchids are found
  below it, which are rare elsewhere. They also both act as a nurse-crop for other
  species, providing shelter for the species that will eventually make up the regenerating
  forest. Kanuka tends to be found on the drier and more fertile soils, whereas Manuka
  will also colonise infertile and poorly drained soils. <br><br>Uses: The name "tea-tree"
  comes from the early bushman who used Manuka and Kanuka leaves to brew a drink similar
  to tea. Captain Cook was the first person to brew tea from manuka and said that
  it had a very agreeable, bitter taste when made with fresh leaves, but lost some
  of it piquancy when made with dry leaves. Kanuka leaves produce a tea that isn''t
  quite as flavourful. Both tea-trees supposedly have medicinal uses and properties
  whose benefits far outweigh any considerations of taste. The leaves, brewed in water,
  help urinary complaints and reduced fevers. <br>The Maori and early settlers used
  to chew young shoots or swallow a drink made from seed capsules as a cure for dysentery
  and diarrhoea. The liquid from boiling the bark was used to treat constipation,
  as a sedative to promote sleep and reduce fever, for bathing sore eyes, treating
  colic, inflamed breasts, scalds and burns. The white gum was applied to scalds and
  burns and was taken by adults and children to relieve coughing. There are much more
  medicinal uses to which tea-tree was put to. Kanuka flowers produce a reasonable
  amount of nectar that is quite favoured by honeybees. The thick golden honey is
  hard to remove from honeycombs, but is quite popular for its strong taste and reputed
  antibacterial properties. Nowadays New Zealand’s monofloral Manuka and Kanuka pharmaceutical
  honey are both renowned for their natural health benefits.<br>The tough wood was
  used by Maori for implements such as fern root beater, mauls, paddles, weapons,
  spade blades, weeders, digging sticks and bird spears. The timber was noted for
  its straight grain, durability and strength by early European settlers, and was
  in demand for wheel-spokes, tool handles and other such purposes. Kanuka and Manuka
  wood is commonly used as firewood, especially for barbeques, or charred into charcoal.
  Older trees of have their trunks covered with a light brown bark that readily strips
  off, and is frequently used for fire-kindling. Both Manuka and Kanuka branches have
  been used to make brush brooms.<br><br>The difference between Kanuka and Manuka<br><br>Kanuka
  is the larger tree, growing up to 10 m. <br>Its foliage is softer to the touch than
  Manuka. <br>The kanuka flowers later than manuka, usually in starting in December,
  with the flowers emerging in bunches or groups. <br>The seed capsules are smaller
  than those of manuka.<br><br>Manuka is a smaller than kanuka, reaching around 4
  m high. <br>It has prickly foliage and a pungent scent. <br>The singular flowers
  are larger than Kanuka and may have a reddish tinge. <br>Manuka flowers in spring
  early summer and the stamens are shorter than the petals.<br>The seed capsules are
  larger than those of Kanuka.<br><br>An old mature tree.<br><img src="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0000/6113/Kanuka2.jpg"
