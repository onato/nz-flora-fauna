  </p> <p class="MsoNormal">Kiekie (Freycinetia banksii) is a densely branched,
  brittle, woody climbing shrub native to New Zealand. It is a member of the screw
  palm family Pandanaceae. Kiekie has numerous cane-like stems up to 40 mm in diameter,
  which freely produce aerial roots. It climbs tree trunks and it can form dense tangles
  on the forest floor. Its stems and leaves are a dominant feature in many areas of
  New Zealand forest, the stems eventually reaching up to 30 m long. The leaves are
  long and slender, 60-90 cm long and 2-2.5 cm broad.

  Possums, rats and birds complete
  for the sweet fruit which ripens.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">The sweet-tasting fruits
  were eaten during winter and the succulent flower bracts (tawhara) were a delicacy
  of the Maori. These were often gathered by using a forked stick. The leaves were
  widely used for plaiting and weaving, although the broader leaves of New Zealand
  flax were preferred because they provided more material. Items that were woven included
  mats and temporary baskets for holding food. The aerial roots were gathered to use
  as a binding material for implements and for making fish traps and sandals. The
  inner leaves of the kiekie were used to produce the finest whariki. (A placemat)</p>
