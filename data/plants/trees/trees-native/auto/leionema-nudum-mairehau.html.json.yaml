name: Leionema nudum (nudum = naked)
description: 'Leionema nudum is a native shrub that endemic to the lowland forests
  of the North Island where it is locally distributed from Te Paki south to Pukenui
  Hill, Kawhia in the west and the northern Kaimai Range in the east. It is rather
  uncommon south of Auckland and Thames.<br><br>Leionema nudum has many branches and
  grows to a height of 4 m. The branchlets are slender with a reddish bark that is
  covered in stellate hairs (a hair that is split into several strands at the free
  end). The stiff, undivided, linear-oblong, alternate, brownish-green leaves are
  20-40 mm long and are arranged along stem. Their margins are toothed and both surfaces
  are dotted with oil glands. The leaves and terminal branchlets when crushed give
  off a pleasant aromatic odour. This is because they contain a clear, greenish-yellow
  essential oil. This oil contains citral, citronellal, cinnamic acid, camphene, limonene,
  and isoborneol. The Māori used the crushed leaves as a perfume.<br>In October it
  has clusters of white bisexual flowers (8-13 mm diam.) which have 5 petals and eight
  to ten long stamens and the sepals are minute. The ovary which sticks up above the
  petals has 4-5 ridges and a long style.<br>The fertilisation flowers develop into
  4-lobed fruit. The fruits dry and each contains four compartments containing 1-2
  seeds.<br><br>Photographed at Otari Native Botanic Garden and Wilton''s Bush Reserve.<a
