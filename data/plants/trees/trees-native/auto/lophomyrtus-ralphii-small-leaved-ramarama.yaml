  'Lophomyrtus ×ralphii is a natural Taranaki hybrid between Lophomyrtus
  bullata and Lophomyrtus obcordata. It has smaller leaves and with fewer-seeded berries
  than the parents. It is an erect branching shrub of about 2 metres or more, sometimes
  becoming a small tree. This feature of hybridization has been commercially exploited
  with a wide range of nursery-bred, selected and named cultivars that derive from
  the same parental stock. The former New Plymouth nursery Duncan Davies, for example,
  released cultivars with such names as ‘Indian Chief’, ‘Katherine’, ‘Purpurea’, ‘Technicolor’,
  ‘Sundae’ and the like, each with some distinct colour or character but all deriving
  one way or the other from Lophomyrtus hybrids.</p> <p>The leaves of Lophomyrtus
  ×ralphii are small &gt;18mm long and have a width of &gt;16mm. There is a small
  notch on the tip of the leaves. 

  

  At the Meeting of the Waters, you can still
  find both the Lophomyrtus parents and intermediate ‘polymorphic’ variations. They
  are easily located on both sides of the Waiwhakaiho River and in the adjacent remnant
  forest, and particularly at the eastern end of the reserve.
