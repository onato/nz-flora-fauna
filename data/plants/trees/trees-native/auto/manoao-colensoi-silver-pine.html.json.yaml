name: Manoao colensoi
description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">The endemic genus Manoao has one species,
  M. colensoi which is a very hardy slow growing small tree 15 m or more in height
  with a straight clear trunk that can be up to 1 m in diameter with slender branchlets.
  In its younger stages the silver pine is a cone-shaped tree but later develops a
  tall, moderately spreading crown. The bark is a brown-grey. <br>There are three
  distinct growth stages, each defined by the foliage. In the juvenile tree, the leaves
  are 6-12 mm long, narrow, pointed, rather limp and spreading with distinct bands
  of stomata on their undersurfaces. As the plant reaches the semi-adult stage, the
  leaves are smaller, 3-4.5 mm long, subfalcate, flattened and arranged in two opposite
  rows in the same plane. The adult leavy twigs are very slender 1,5 mm in diameter.
  <br>Male and female cones occur in abundance on separate trees or the same tree.
  The male cones are about 5 mm long with 12-15 scales. Female cones are reduced to
  6-7 scales with 1-2 fertile scales at the tip. When ripe the bluish black seed is
  exposed in a fleshy green cup formed by the enlargement of the fertile scale.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Manoao occurs in high-rainfall areas throughout the northern
  half of the North Island and west of the Southern Alps on the South Island from
  sea level to an altitude of about 950. It is notably absent from large parts of
  the North Island, eastern South Island, Fiordland, and Stewart Island. Usually,
  it is found on older, poorly drained surfaces with leached infertile soils and in
  acid swamps and peats. <br>It is often confused with <a href="friends-of-te-henui-group/trees-native-botanical-names-g-to-l/halocarpus-biformis-yellow-pine.html"
