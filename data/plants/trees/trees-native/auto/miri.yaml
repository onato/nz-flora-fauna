  '</p> <p>Miro (Prumnopitys ferruginea) is a forest tree favouring shady
  damp sites and grows to a height of approx 25 metres. 

  The trunk is smooth, branchless,
  and grey with a flaking hammer-marked bark, growing to a diameter of 1.3 meters.
  

  The bark flacks off in thick round chunks which leave brown blotches on the
  trunk.

  It has similar foliage to Totara with stiff dark leaves on branchlets
  in two rows. They have dark green, feathery, needle-like leaves flattened into two
  rows. Juvenile leaves are longer than the adult leaves.

  Each year (March- June)
  miro produces a regular crop of fleshy, large bright red seeds, which smell strongly
  of turpentine. The seeds are an important food for forest birds in winter. Maori
  hunted kereru (native pigeons) at this time, as the birds often gorged themselves
  on so many seeds that they could barely fly.

  

  Miro is distinguished from the
  related and very similar looking Matai (Prumnopitys taxifolia) in four aspects of
  its anatomy; its cones, bark, seeds and leaves. Miro trees have longer, broader
  leaves with green undersides while those of Matai leaves are white. In addition,
  the leaves of Miro generally narrow to a point, whereas those of Matai are rounded,
  sometimes with a small point right at the very tip. Miro trees have cones of some
  hue of red in colour while those of Matai are blue-black. Miro also has relatively
  longer cones which are oval and red in colour. Like Matai, the bark of more mature
  Miro trees flakes off to leave a distinctive "hammer mark pattern", but unlike Matai,
  the colourful (areas from which bark flakes have recently fallen in Matai often
  have a striking red colour that fades over time back to brown). 

  Miro is one
  of Ngai Tahu''s toanga (treasured) species. Its timber is straight and strong, similar
  to rimu. Its leaves, fruit, bark and gum provided food, aromatic oils and various
  medical and antiseptic uses.

  In the past, miro was used mainly for building houses.
  The timber looks like rimu and has similar properties.
