description: >
  'Nestegis apetala is a small tree native to the North Island mainland
  on rocky headlands around Whangarei Heads and at the Bay of Islands. It is also
  found on northern offshore islands including the Hen and Chickens Islands, Great
  Barrier Island, Little Barrier Island, and the Poor Knights Islands. It is also
  on Norfolk Island. The species name apetala refers to the lack of petals on the
  flowers.

  Nestegis apetala is shrub or tree up to 6 m tall, with smooth, shiny
  dark green leaves 4.5 to 12 cm long and 1.5 to 4 cm wide. Juvenile leaves are larger,
  up to 14 cm long by 8.5 cm wide. The leaves are often wavy, and are borne on leaf
  stems about 10 mm long. The flowers of N. apetala arise in racemes of up to 21 flowers
  growing from the leaf axils or directly from the branchlets. The individual flowers
  are each about 2.5 mm in diameter, and lack petals. The fruit is a drupe 9 mm long,
  red or yellow, less commonly purple when ripe.</p> <p><img src="uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Trees/1-NestegisApetala.jpg"
