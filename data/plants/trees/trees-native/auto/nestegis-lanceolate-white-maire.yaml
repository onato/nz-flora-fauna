  found from lowland to hilly forests up to 600 metres altitude across the North Island.
  In the South Island, it’s uncommon and is found in the NW corner.

  It is a canopy
  tree with a straight trunk and grows to approximately 15 metres high. Is bark is
  rough and furrowed and the branchlets have pale bark.

  Nestegis lanceolate has
  long (5-12 cm x 1-3.5cm), leathery and glossy leaves. These leaves have smooth margins
  and a midrib that is level with the surface, underside has only a midrib visible.

  Flowerheads
  are 1-2cm long, containing about 5-10 tiny (2mm) greenish flowers and produced in
  spring and are followed by a 1 cm long fruit that tapers at the end. They are green
  at first turning red when ripe</p> <p>The wood of N. lanceolata is one the hardest
