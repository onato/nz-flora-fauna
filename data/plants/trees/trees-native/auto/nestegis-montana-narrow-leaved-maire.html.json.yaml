name: Nestegis montana
description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Nestegis montana is a canopy tree up to 15
  m tall with a trunk up to 50 cm in diameter. It can occasionally bear 2 or more
  trunks from base these being slender and straight with grey-brown firm bark. <br>The
  twigs are very slender. <br>The adult leaves are 7 cm long and 6 mm wide and are
  narrow with points. They are dark glossy green above, paler beneath. Green flowers
  which are bisexual are on non branched inflorescences which grow from the leaf axils.
  They appear from spring to summer and bright red fruit appear from summer to autumn.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It grows in the North Island from near Kaitaia south to the
  Waimea Plain in Nelson. It is scarce in the southern North Island (where it is most
  common in the eastern Wairarapa) and is very rare in the South Island. The Department
  of Conservation has recorded a small number growing near Kaikoura, there is an unsubstantiated
  report of the trees occurring in the Pelorus Valley near Havelock and five only
  remain at Waimea West near Nelson. <br>Where N. montana grows it is widespread though
  rarely abundant in coastal to montane forests. Often found on steep hill slopes
  and ridgelines but also can be locally common in riparian forest especially on the
  margins of forest flats and tomo or dolines in karst country. Narrow-leaved maire
  is unusually common on the sand country of the Pouto Peninsula where it can at times
  dominate the local coastal forest. In Taranaki, it is growing on Mt Egmont/Taranaki
  and Rotokare Scenic Reserve.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0003/6384/nestegis_montana__narrow-leaved_maire-001.JPG"
