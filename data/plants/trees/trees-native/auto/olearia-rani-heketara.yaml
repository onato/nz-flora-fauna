name: Olearia rani
description: >
  'Olearia rani is a common small forest tree of New Zealand growing up
  to 8 metres in height when the conditions are right. It grows in dry lowland forest
  throughout the North Island and in the northern half of the South Island. It is
  often seen as a small to medium shrub in regenerating forest or on the edges of
  clearings.

  There are two variations, Olearia rani var. rani and Olearia rani
  var. colorata.

  Olearia rani var. rani occurs from Te Paki south to Northern Waikato
  and the Coromandel Peninsula

  Olearia rani var. colorata grows from the Waikato
  south to the Northern South Island.</p> <p>Olearia rani leaves have white undersides
  and prominent veins. During the spring the tree produces clusters of small white
  daisy-like flowers. The seeds are dispersed by the wind.

  Maori sometimes transplanted
  this shrub and grew them near their villages. They used the leaves to give an agreeable
  scent to shark oil which was used as a cosmetic. The crushed leaves mixed with kōpuru
  moss was used to impart a pleasing odour to their clothing.
