  '</p> <p>Pennantia baylisiana is a critically endangered species of plant
  in the Pennantiaceae family (Icacinaceae in older classifications). It is endemic
  to the Great Island (Manawa Tawhi), Three Kings Islands, New Zealand, where only
  one plant is known to exist. It is threatened by habitat loss. Pennantia baylisiana
  was once listed as one of the world''s rarest plants by The Guinness Book of Records.
  The single tree known in the wild grows on a scree slope on the northern face of
  Great Island in the Three Kings group off Cape Reinga, New Zealand. It was discovered
  during a hunting exercise to rid the islands of goats. Professor Geoff Baylis of
  the University of Otago found both it in 1945. It had been reduced by the goats''
  foraging to a single specimen. It is still alive today some 65 years later, and
  has not produced any seedlings on the islands. Cuttings from the tree were taken
  to the Government research station at Mt Albert. The tree is functionally a female
  and as such did not produce any seed. Forty years after the Pennantia was found
  Ross Beever (1946-2010) a scientist with Landcare Research determined to try some
  experiments to see if he could induce it to produce seed. He was successful and
  the resulting seedlings have proved to be more fertile than their mother. From having
  been the rarest tree in the world (Guinness Book of Records) it is now widespread
  in cultivation, and Oratia Native Plant Nursery which assisted Ross in his project,
  now donates all the proceeds from the sale of Pennantias to help fund botanical
  research and to minimise the risk of extinction of other species.

  The first seedlings
  of Pennantia baylisiana were sold at the Ellerslie Flower Show in 2002 at a premium
  price with all profits going to three conservation groups. 

   A tree is growing
  in Pukekura Park, New Plymouth.</p> <p>Pennantia baylisiana is a sturdy, multi-trunked
  tree 5-8 x 4 m tall with large, roundest, dark green, leathery, smooth, leaves.
  On shaded plants, the leaves the leaves are flat while plants in the sun have smaller
  leaves and these are strongly rolled under at the margins.</p> <p>For more details
