  'Peraxilla colensoi is a native parasitic shrub mainly found in silver
  beech forests usually at lower altitudes (up to 500 m) in the North and South Islands,
  from Mt Te Aroha to Southland. It''s more common in southern parts of the South
  Island. It has been recorded on 16 host species (9 are exotic). The native trees
  include the red beech (Fuscospora fusca), black beech (Fuscospora solandri), silver
  beech (Nothofagus menziesii, tawa (Beilschmiedia tawa), Metrosideros (rata) and
  Lemonwood (Pittosporum eugenioides)

  

  Its scrubby plant that is up to 3 m across
  and it has broad, leathery leaves (3-8 cm long) in opposite pairs. Only the main
  midrib is conspicuous on the leaves. The leaves tips are never notched and they
  have smooth margins that are slightly red in colour. During October â€“ January masses
  of scarlet flowers heads are produced. The 60 mm long, tubular flowers are in groups
  of &gt;10.

  The flowers are pollinated by the Tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae)
  and the bellbird (Anthonis melanura). the flower buds are unable to open themselves.
  They only open when nectar feeding birds give the top of the flower a twist. It
  then immediately opens and then the bird drinks the nectar inside and fertilises
  the flower. 

  Flowering is followed by small, fleshy, oval fruit which ripens
  to a yellow/golden colour.

  

  The beech mistletoes have all declined in abundance
  in recent decades. Their main threats are listed below:

   1 Peraxilla colensoi
  is under threat from the Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) which
  heavily browse mistletoes to such an extent that they are held as the primary cause
  for the loss of the beech mistletoes from large parts of the countries beech forests.

  
  2 Flower predation by Zelleria maculate, a widespread endemic moth whose caterpillar
  feed inside the flower buds impacting the fruit set.

   3 Habitat modification
  and loss have had an effect. Mistletoe decline is exacerbated by the serious loss
  of potential host beech trees in settled areas. Because of animal browsing around
  the beech trees, there are few beech seedlings. A beech tree has to be a couple
  of metres high before mistletoes will establish on it.

   4 The decline of birds
  (chiefly bellbird and tui) associated with pollination and dispersal.

   5 Fungal
  disease is also a problem.
