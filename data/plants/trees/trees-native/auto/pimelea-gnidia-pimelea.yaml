  Pimelea gnidia is a New
  Zealand bushy shrub growing up to 1.5 m tall. Its young branches are a reddish colour
  but on the older branches, the bark is grey. The branches bear pairs of bright green
  pointed leaves (5-35mm long by 2-7mm wide) on very short petioles. 

  The flowers
  appear October to January on inflorescences. The flower numbers can vary from a
  few too many on each inflorescence. They are fragrant, hairy and are usually white
  or a white flushed with pink.

  This endemic shrub inhabits areas of high rainfall
  from the Tararua Range in the North Island south to Fiordland. In the upper range
  of it is found in montane to subalpine areas while it can be present in coastal
  or lowland areas in the most southern areas.

  

  Photographed February in Abel
  Tasman Park.
