name: Pisonia brunoniana
description: '<p>Pisonia brunoniana is native to Northland New Zealand, Norfolk Island,
  Lord Howe Island and Hawaii. In New Zealand, it grows in coastal forests on Raoul
  Island in the Kermadec group, on the Three Kings Islands, and in the North Island
  in scattered locations from Whangape Harbour to Mangawhai. It is now mainly found
  on offshore islands, especially rodent-free islands, where it often forms an important
  understory component of a mixed-broadleaf forest.<br><br>The tree is almost extinct
  in the North Island, partly because the large leaves of P. brunoniana are eagerly
  eaten by browsing animals such as possums, goats and feral cattle. However, the
  main threat to accessible populations is the cutting down of trees by people trying
  to prevent small songbirds from becoming trapped by the sticky seeds. <br>Horticulturists
  advise the deadheading of the flowers and pods if small native birds like the fantail
  are present.</p> <p>Pisonia brunoniana is a small, spreading tree &gt;6 metres or
  taller. The wood is soft and the branches are brittle. <br>The large leaves are
  opposite or ternate, glabrous, and glossy, entire, and obtuse to round at apex.
  Size (10-50 X 5-20 cm).<br>The inflorescence is paniculata (a branched cluster of
  flowers in which the branches are racemes), with many flowers which are unisexual.
  <br>The seeds of P. brunoniana turn black and become sticky as they ripen. They
  narrowly ellipsoidal 2–3 centimetres long and have five ribs. These seeds are too
  long for a bird to swallow but with the adhesive on them they adhere to the bird’s
  feathers and are carried away. The birds come to the tree because the tree produces
  a pheromone odour that attracts insects. The insects get stuck on the seeds and
  this, in turn, attracts hungry birds. <br>Some birds do get ensnared in the bunches
  of the slender sticky seeds and because of this bird rescue, people have been in
  the forefront of protests about Pisonia brunoniana. Observations made by botanists
  over many years suggest it is mainly the inexperienced exotic birds and urban dwellers
  that get caught. The native species in the real wild on off-shore islands where
  there are many ''bird-catcher trees'' seem to know to avoid the trap.<br><br>There
  is a variegated form: Pisonia ''Variegata'' which is reasonably common in cultivation
  as a decorative tree in New Zealand. Visit page:: <a href="friends-of-te-henui-group/trees-native-botanical-names-m-to-q/pisonia-brunoniana-variegata-variegated-parapara.html"
