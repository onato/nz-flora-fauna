name: Pittosporum dallii
description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Pittosporum dallii is an endangered spreading,
  evergreen, large shrub or small tree endemic to low forest and scrublands usually
  amongst rocks at a few isolated locations in the mountains of north-west Nelson,
  South Island, New Zealand. All known populations occur within the Kahurangi National
  Park and have a distribution centred on the Cobb and Takaka Rivers. <br>It is threatened
  at all known localities by the browsing of deer and possums and hence current occurrences
  are on or near cliff faces or walking tracks which are locations less prone to the
  influence of these browsing animals. It grows up to 6 m high with spreading branches
  and a smooth grey to a dark brown trunk. <br>This very distinctive species is immediately
  recognised by the dark purple-black or reddish-purple stems and the serrated leaves.
  The leathery, dull, spear-shaped, green leaves are up to 10 cm long and up to 3.5
  cm wide. They have a toothed margin on the upper half of leaver. The leaves are
  clustered towards the ends of the branches. Clusters of scented creamy-white flowers
  on umbellate inflorescences appear during spring and summer. <br>Dark brown 12mm
  long seed capsules with a very rough surface appear late summer to autumn.</p> <p
