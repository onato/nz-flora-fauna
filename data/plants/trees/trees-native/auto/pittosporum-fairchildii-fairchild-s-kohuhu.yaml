  coastal forest and the sheltered cliff faces of New Zealand’s Three Kings Islands
  where it is known from North East, Great (Manawa Tawhi), South East and West islands.

  individuals (i. e. females) coexist with hermaphroditic individuals in populations)
  shrub to small tree 5 m tall. The brown trunk is smooth and can be branched from
  the ground. 

  The dark to light green leaves ( 7.5 cm long 3.5 cm wide) with the
  sides sometimes rolled under. The undersurface of the leaves is a pale green with
  a network of veins visible. 

  Flowering and fruiting occur late winter to spring.
  The dark red to nearly black flowers (12 mm diameter) are terminal in 2-4-flowered
  clusters.
