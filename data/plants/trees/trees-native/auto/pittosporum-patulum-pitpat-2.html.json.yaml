name: Pittosporum patulum
description: 'Pittosporum patulum a small (&gt;6m) naturally uncommon tree found only
  in the eastern South Island, occurring in northwest Nelson and sporadically from
  inland Marlborough to Wanaka. It occurs in sub-alpine scrub and in canopy gaps of
  mountain beech forest above 800 metres. It is sometimes locally common as a juvenile
  in the understory and occasionally forms a small tree in the sub-canopy. Most adult
  plants are found at open sitesâ€“ avalanche terrain, river margins, on bluffs or above
  the tree line.<br>Pittosporum patulum is notable for having distinctly different
  juvenile and adult stages of growth (heteroblasty). Juveniles have a single stem,
  with sparse branches and dark, narrow leaves that are toothed along the edges.<br>The
  adults are small trees, with whitish-grey smooth bark, many spreading branches at
  their tops, and leaves that are shorter, broader and less toothed than juveniles.<br>Adult
  trees produce very fragrant deep red cup-shaped flowers during late spring and early
  summer. The seeds are probably dispersed by birds but very little is known about
  how flowers are pollinated.<br><br>Pittosporum patulum is in decline is due to browsing
  by introduced mammals. Possums, in particular, appear to target adult plants, causing
  severe canopy defoliation and death, which is likely to be the reason why so few
  adults remain in most populations today. Deer and goats also contribute to the decline
  of this species by browsing saplings and seedlings. Rodents are known to eat Pittosporum
  patulum seeds in the litter beneath adult trees. Browsing insects also have the
  ability to deform new growth.<br><br>Photographed in the Temple catchment (near
  Lake Ohau).<br><a href="uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Trees/Pittosporum%20patulum-001.JPG"
