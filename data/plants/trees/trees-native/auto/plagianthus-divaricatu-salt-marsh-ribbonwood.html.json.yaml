  to New Zealand. It is naturally found throughout New Zealand in coastal environments,
  in areas with salt swamp, sandy banks and throughout estuaries. This hardy shrub
  is now cultivated well inland including alpine situations. <br><br>Plagianthus divaricatus
  is a small, upright, many-branched shrub that grows up to 3 m tall. It forms dense
  thickets of reddish-brown, intertwined stems.<br>It has tiny, undivided, linear,
  spoon-shaped leaves are 5-20 mm long by 0.5-2mm wide. The leaves have hairs on their
  surface and their margins are smooth. The leaf arrangement is alternate or in groups.<br>Masses
  of small, drooping, cream, strong vanilla scented 5 petaled flowers are produced
  in spring. The 8-12 stamens colour the flowers centre yellow. The flowers are unisexual
  on different plants.<br>The flowers are followed by 5mm wide fruit capsules containing
  small seeds. The seeds are dispersed by floating on water. The seed capsules are
  attractive to native birds.<br>Plagianthus divaricatus is now used as a coastal
  wetland plant for coastal revegetation and restoration planting.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0012/5398/Plagianthus_divaricatus_.JPG"
