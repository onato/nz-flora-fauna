name: Planchonella costata
description: '</p> <p>Planchonella costata which is strictly coastal is naturally
  found locally on islands and headlands along the northern coasts of the North Island,
  from North Cape to Tolaga Bay on the east coast, but only as far as the Kawhia Harbour
  in the west. It is also present on Norfolk Island.<br>Planchonella costata grows
  growing in association with pōhutukawa, karaka and taraire. It grows from sea level
  to about 450 m, always close to the sea. <br>P. costata is fairly slow growing,
  closely branched tree that prefers coastal conditions. It grows up to 8–15 m or
  taller with a trunk up to 1 m in diameter. It prefers semi-shade and is frost tender.<br>The
  bark is rough and varies in colour from grey to brownish-grey. <br>The leathery,
  glossy green leaves measure from 5 to 10 cm (sometimes up to 15 cm) long and 2 to
  5 cm wide. The main vein in the centre of the leaf is distinct above and below,
  as are the primary veins on each side of it, which number from 14 to 20. The branchlets
  and leaf stems are covered with fine flattened hairs. <br>Small, greenish flowers
  (4-6 mm in diameter) are followed by bright red berries (2.5–4 cm long) which contain
  2 or 4 hard, curved, polished seeds. These glossy seeds were used as necklaces by
  the Maori. <br>The fruit is consumed by the kererū, the New Zealand pigeon, and
  the kākā parrot. The fruit and seeds of P. costata are also very palatable to rats.
  Research in New Zealand has shown that the eating of the fruit and the destruction
  of the seeds by kiore (Pacific rats) has substantially reduced the population of
  the tree and significantly altered the composition of the coastal forests of the
  northern North Island. Tawapou is common on rodent-free offshore islands in the
  Hauraki Gulf, around the Coromandel Peninsula, Great Barrier Island, and on the
  Mokohinau, Poor Knights, Hen &amp; Chickens and the Three Kings Islands.<br><br>The
  white-coloured wood is hard and durable and the Māori use Tawāpou logs as rollers
  to help bring large canoes onshore.</p> <p>For more details visit: <a href="http://nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.asp?ID=2227"
