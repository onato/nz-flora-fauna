  Common name: Tauhinu (other members of the genus: Pomaderris are
  also called Tauhinu), Wrinkle-leaf pomaderris

  

  Pomaderris amoena is a small
  indigenous shrub that can be common locally. Pomaderris is a genus of around 70
  species most of which are endemic to Australia.

  Pomaderris amoena is endemic
  to the Three Kings Islands, the North and the South Islands where it is generally
  scarce. It has a preference for open habitats on coastal farmlands and coastal open
  shrublands, roadside banks, rocky headlands, sand country and the northern gumlands
  on the east coast of the North Island. It is occasionally found well inland in montane
  situations.</p> <p>Pomaderris amoena is a small, sprawling, fast-growing, perennial
  shrub growing up to a maximum height of 3 metres in 10–15 years. Its leaves and
  stems are covered in unbranched hairs. The wrinkled, undivided, narrow-linear, bright
  green leaves are 5-10mm long by 1-2mm wide. The leaves margins are rolled under
  and the midrib is recessed. They are attached by a stipule, singly along the stems.

  

  From
  mid-September to summer clusters of creamy yellow, bisexual, symmetric flowers (4
  mm diam) appear in many-flowered panicles. The flowers have no petals, 5 sepals,
  5 stamens and 5 sepals which look like petals. The seeds are small and germinate
  easily on bare soils.

  

  The early Maori made large wooden fish hooks for big
  prey such as häpuku (groper) from the hard roots of the tauhinu tree. These were
  further them hardened by fire.
