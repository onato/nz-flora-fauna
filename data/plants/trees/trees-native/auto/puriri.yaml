  'Puriri is one of the few native trees with large colourful flowers.
  Many plants in New Zealand have white or green flowers. The tubular flowers of the
  puriri look rather like snapdragon flowers and can range from fluorescent pink to
  dark red, rose pink (most common) or sometimes even to a white flower with a yellow
  or pink blush. The bright colour, the tube shape, copious nectar production and
  the hairs at the base of the flower tube all point towards birds pollinating this
  flower (the hairs stop insects from stealing the nectar).

  On the New Zealand
  mainland, there is often plenty of nectar in the flowers because there aren''t enough
  birds to eat all the nectar produced by the tree. 

  The flower produces a rugged
  ribbed ''stone'' which has scales on 4 sides. When these fall these scales allow
  moisture to penetrate the wood. This, in turn, swells the 4 seeds and they can all
  germinate together pushing the scales aside to emerge as 4 separate individuals
  clinging to their woody capsule. Generally, only one seed will eventually develop
  into a large tree.

  

  Puriri was actively and selectively logged in the past
  to provided timber for a wide range of end uses. Only the best trees were felled,
  leaving the gnarled puriri often found on farm paddocks. This has given the impression
  that puriri is incapable of growing straight, but early reports of puriri describe
  naturally clear boles of 4.5 to 9 m and there are still a few trees like that left.

  

  Traditional
  uses by the Maori.

  An infusion of the leaves from this noble tree contains a
  powerful germicide. The leaves were boiled It was valued for bathing sprains and
  backache. The infusion aided ulcers &amp;sore throats. The bark was a source of
  dye.

  This a small tree is growing on wasteland
  next to a motorway. The seed must have been excreted here by a bird. Fruit-eating
  birds play an important ecological role in dispersing seeds of podocarp and broadleaf
  trees and shrubs here in New Zealand. Their job is essential in sustaining healthy
  forests and regenerating new forest. The Kereru (New Zealand pigeon) Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae
  play a key role, consuming fruit and excreting the seeds of at least 70 plant species,
  including 16 large native trees. The Tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae) is the
  second most important seed disperser of native plants and trees. There 7 introduced
  bird species that also eat small quantities of fruit.<a style="font-size: 1em; line-height:
