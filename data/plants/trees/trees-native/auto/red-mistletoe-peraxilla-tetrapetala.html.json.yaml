name: Peraxilla tetrapetala
description: 'Peraxilla tetrapetala is an endemic parasitic plant in New Zealand.
  It is a shrub up to one metre tall with glabrous leaves. The flowers are 4-5 mm
  long, bright red to orange in colour which split open to the base. Red mistletoe
  is found as a parasitic plant on Quintinia and Nothofagus species.<br>In Taranaki,
  this plant can only be found in the northern area of the province and is in decline.<br></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The plant is highly palatable to the introduced Common Brushtail
  Possum resulting in a threat to the plant population. Red mistletoe is listed as
  in "Gradual Decline" in the New Zealand Threat Classification System and relies
  on conservation measures to halt the decline.<br><br>Photographed March<br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0003/6874/Red_Mistletoe__Peraxilla_tetrapetaia__-7.JPG"
