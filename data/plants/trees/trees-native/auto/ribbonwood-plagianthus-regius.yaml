  'Plagianthus regius subsp. regius is one of New Zealand’s few deciduous
  trees. Plagianthus regius is found over most of New Zealand, including Stewart Island
  and the Chatham Islands, but is absent from North Cape and Ninety Mile Beach in
  the far north. It grows in riparian habitats from sea level to 1500 ft, preferring
  moist soil. It has a distinct seedling, juvenile and adult forms.

  The seedling
  form has an erect habit, and foliage similar to the adult form, but with truncate
  or cordate leaf bases. 

  The juvenile form is a dense bush of slender, interlaced,
  branches. The leaves are ovate, &gt;15mm × &gt;10mm, and margins serrated. 

  In
  its adult form, it is New Zealand''s largest deciduous tree, reaching 15 m in height.
  The adult form, in its earlier stages, is a graceful, small to medium tree, reminiscent
  of the habit of a Silver Birch. When older it becomes broader and bulkier. A specimen
  growing in an open location in Christchurch has a spread of 15m and a trunk with
  a diameter of 1m.

  The foliage consists of ovate to ovate-lanceolate, toothed,
  leaves &gt; 7.5 cm long and &gt; 5 cm wide, with a covering of stellate hairs on
  both surfaces. The leaves are strongly narrowed to the tip.

  The yellowish-white
  flowers are small, 3-4 mm in diameter and hang in large, terminal panicles, in mid-spring.
  The male and females flowers are on different trees. Some male trees may have a
  few bisexual flowers. After the male flowers release their pollen they drop. The
  flowers petals are linear-oblong (narrower in male than in female flowers) and rounded
  at their tips. 

  The fruit is a small, ovoid, creamy coloured, single-seeded,
  capsule, which on maturity splits down one side.

  The tree’s bark will peel off
  in lace-like strips yielding a strong fibre that resembles flax and was used for
  tying.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">A photo of an adult tree at California Park, Upper
