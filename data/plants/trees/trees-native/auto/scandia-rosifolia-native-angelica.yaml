  '</p> <p>Scandia rosifolia is a rare native semi-erect sprawling woody
  shrub growing to a height of 1m and a 1.5m spread. It has shiny grass green foliage
  like the leaves of a rose, hence the Latin name rosifolia. It develops dill like
  white flowers September – June. The leaves margins are fine to deeply serrated.

  It
  is endemic in the North Island, from the Three Kings south to Taranaki in the west
  and the southern RuahineRanges in the east growing in coastal situations on cliffs
  and banks. It can be seen growing by New Plymouth’s Kawaroa swimming pool fence.
  It is a threatened species and is currently classified as ''declining'' in the wild.

  Medically
  this aromatic herb was used by the Maoris. The leaves used as a diuretic, for dropsy,
  and as a remedy for syphilitic disease. (Colenso 1869a).
