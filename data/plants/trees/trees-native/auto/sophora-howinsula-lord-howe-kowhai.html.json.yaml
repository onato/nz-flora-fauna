name: Sophora howinsula
description: 'Sophora howinsula an evergreen shrub or small tree native to Lord Howe
  Island where it can still be found scattered on some lowland hills. Though it has
  been growing in New Zealand for many years some say it should be regarded as an
  Australian species as recent research has shown the plant originates from seed collected
  on Lord Howe Island. It grows up to 15m tall and is similar to the New Zealand kowhai
  species Sophora tetraptera, sharing similar golden flowers which it produces in
  spring. Sophora howinsula leaflets are larger. An unusual feature of this tree is
  the large woody swelling at the base of the stem, known as a lignotuber. <br>This
  species hybridises with the New Zealand natives and several garden hybrids and cultivars
  are available, including ''Otari Gnome'' and ''Tui''s Gold''.<br><br>Photographed
  at Otari-Wilton''s bush in Wellington, New Zealand.<br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0005/6174/Sophora_howinsula__Lord_Howe_Kowhai_-003.JPG"
