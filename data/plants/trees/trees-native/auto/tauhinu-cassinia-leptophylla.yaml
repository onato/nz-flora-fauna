name: Ozothamnus leptophyllus
description: >
  '</p> <p>Ozothamnus leptophyllus is a common very variable evergreen
  New Zealand native shrub in coastal areas, especially sand dunes. It is common in
  eastern areas of the North Island from North Cape southwards and is common in Wairoa,
  Wairarapa, Wellington, Marlborough Sounds and Central Otago. It is also found on
  Stewart and the Auckland Islands.

  It is a bushy shrub (&gt;2m) with small silver-green
  leaves with fine silver hair beneath. The stems are silver/white in colour. It has
  an attractive silver-grey appearance and from July to August it flowers in profusion
  with clusters of tiny cream daisy (wheel-shaped) flowers followed by down-covered
  seed heads. The fruits are small, dry, indehiscent one-seeded fruit with a thin
  wall. The seeds are dispersed by the wind. The tiny daisy seeds germinate and establish
  themselves easily on bare soils and in an overgrazed pasture. 

  Ozothamnus leptophyllus
  is fast-growing, reaching its maximum height of 2 metres in 10–15 years. Unless
  their understorey plants are heavily grazed, tauhinu shrublands are usually overtopped
  by taller shrubs and trees, and develop into the coastal broadleaved scrub. Ozothamnus
  leptophyllus prefers a sunny location and will tolerate temperatures down to -12.2
  º C. 

  A crude extract from Ozothamnus leptophyllus was shown to possess antifungal
  activity. Flavonoids, mainly chalcones in the leaf exudate, were isolated, some
  of which possessed antiviral as well as antifungal activity.

  It is listed NZ
  Common Weeds in Colour by E.A. Uprichard.</p> <p>Photographed at Te Kainga Marire

  at Cape Reinga.

  Historically, Ozothamnus in New Zealand has been separated into
  five endemic species and seven varieties, and more recently united into a single,
  undivided, but polymorphic species. However, investigation leading to the recognition
  of a single species was limited and many botanists continue to recognise different
  forms within this species based on appearance and distribution. The conflicting
  taxonomic opinions regarding O. leptophyllus are influenced by complex patterns
  of variation, mostly quantitative taxonomic characters, and wide distribution with
  overlapping ranges. 

  In order to resolve the taxonomy of O. leptophyllus, it
  has been assessed morphological and genetic diversity within and among populations
  from throughout New Zealand. Unfortunately, this work is still waiting to be published.

  The
  plant in the images below is what was previously called Cassinia retorta. For now,
  it is called Ozothamnus leptophyllus, but once the revision is published it will
  be a distinct taxon again.
