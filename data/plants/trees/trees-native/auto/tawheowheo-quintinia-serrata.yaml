  '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Quintinia is an extremely variable plant.
  Some scientists consider it to be three separate species, calling two of its forms
  Quintinia acutifolia and Q. elliptica. 

  Tawheowheo occurs in two distinct regions
  of New Zealand: it grows in lowland and mountain forests in the northern half of
  North Island, is absent from the southern North Island, then reappears in the west
  of the South Island as far south as Fox Glacier.

  Tawheowheo grows to about 12
  metres in height and has mottled, narrow leaves with wavy edges. It produces 5â€“10-centimetre
  spikes of tiny cream flowers in spring, and dry brown seed capsules in mid-summer.
  Te Henui This specimen was planted by NPDC some years ago on the Te henui walkway.
