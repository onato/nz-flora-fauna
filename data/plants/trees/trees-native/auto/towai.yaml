  'Weinmannia silvicola known as Towai or Tawhero is a medium-sized tree
  of the family Cunoniaceae, is a very common tree in the north of the North Island
  of New Zealand, occurring in forest and forest margins from North Cape south to
  the latitude 38°S. 

  Weinmannia silvicola grows up to 15 metres tall or more,
  with a trunk up to 1 metre in diameter. The bark is smooth and the young twigs and
  leaves are hairy. 

  Flowering occurs spring to early summer and the white inflorescence
  are at the branch tips and are 8-12 cm. long racemes holding the individual flowers
  on pedicels that are 2-3mm long. These flowers are not overly perfumed. The capsules
  ripen through summer. The dry capsules release tiny seeds which are dispersed by
  the wind. 

  

  The leaves of adult trees are 4-7cm long by 2-3cm wide and are
  thick and leathery. The surface is green and shiny and the leaf margins are bluntly
  toothed. Weinmannia silvicola can be easily distinguished by the leaves on mature
  trees which comprise up to five adjacent pairs of leaflets plus one relatively large
  terminal leaflet. 

  The juvenile trees have a great variety of leaf forms which
  adds to the confusion with Weinmannia racemosa and Ackama rosifolia (Makamaka).
  It can be distinguished from Ackama rosifolia by the lack of domatia on the underside
  of the leaves and they also have narrow, linear stipules (a small leaf-like appendage
  to a leaf, typically borne in pairs at the base of the leaf stalk.) that fall off
  early. 

  

  The Maoris use to infuse bark in boiling water and this was used
  for skin diseases. They use to scrape off the rough outside bark from the side of
  the tree facing the sun and use the clean inner bark. They would hammer it and put
  it into a billy with some water. They boiled it for about half an hour then took
  out the bark and stain the liquid through a clean cloth. They use to bath the cut
  with this liquid then bandaged it. Sometimes raupo was used as a bandage. It is
  said the treatment did not leave a scar. The bark which contains large amounts of
  tannins (was used in tanning) and it was also used in dyeing.
