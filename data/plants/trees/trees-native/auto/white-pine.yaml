  '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">They are the oldest member of the ancient
  Podocarp family and have been around for more than 160 million years. Kahikatea
  is sometimes called dinosaur trees because they existed alongside the dinosaurs
  during the Jurassic period. They support whole ecosystems on their trunks and branches.
  A scientist once found 28 different plants living on one tree. They love fertile
  swampy ground which is why the best Kahikatea forests are found on the wet West
  Coast.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Dacrycarpus dacrydioides is a coniferous tree endemic
  to New Zealand. The tree grows to a height of 55 m with a trunk exceeding one m
  in diameter and is buttressed at the base and lives for over 500 years. It is dominant
  in lowland forest and wetlands throughout the North and South Islands. The leaves
  are spirally arranged on young plants, they are awl-shaped 3 to 8 mm long and twisted
  at the base to lay spread to the sides of the shoot in a flat plane; on mature trees,
  they are scale-like, 1 to 3 mm long, and placed all around the shoot. The cones
  are highly modified with the cone scales swelling at maturity into an orange to
  red, fleshy aril with a single apical seed 3 to 5 mm in diameter. The seeds are
  dispersed by birds which eat the fleshy scale and pass the seeds in their droppings.
  

  Before extensive logging trees of 80 m height were known and a specimen at Pirongia
  Forest Reserve is the tallest native tree in New Zealand at 80.1 m. Until recently
  the tree was more likely to be referred to by the misleading name "white pine" despite
  it is not being a pine 

   

  The Maori name kahikatea is now more widely used
  than kahika, katea, Like many other species in the family Podocarpaceae, the classification
  of kahikatea has changed over time, having also been placed in the genera Podocarpus
  and Nageia.

   <!--[endif]--></p> <p class="MsoNormal">The wood was tough, easy
  to work but not durable in weather and prone to attack by wood-boring insects. Since
  the wood does not impart an odour and is clean and lightweight, Kahikatea was used
  to make boxes for the exporting of butter when the refrigerated export became feasible
  from Australia and New Zealand in the 1880s. The butter was exported in 56 lb slabs,
  and kahikatea became less common as the export industry grew. When treated it was
  used for scaffold planks, weatherboards, fascia boards, mouldings, window sashes,
  feature panelling and in boat building. 

   

  For Maori, the kahikatea had many
  uses. The fleshy aril or koroi was an important food resource and was served at
  feasts in great amounts. The constructed the waka (canoe) with it. Soot obtained
  from burning the heartwood supplied a pigment for traditional tattooing (ta moko).
  The wood was also favoured for making bird spears.

  Nowadays Kahikatea along with
  other tree species in privately owned forests can only be harvested under a permit
  system and only if sustainable harvesting techniques are used.

  When fully grown it sheds large flakes
  of bark, leaving a wavy pattern on the trunk.
