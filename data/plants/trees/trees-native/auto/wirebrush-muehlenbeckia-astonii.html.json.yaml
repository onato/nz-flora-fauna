  grow in clusters of 2 or 3, or alternate along the longer branchlets.<br>Flowers
  are tiny and grow in clusters of 2 to 4, less than 1 cm in diameter, greenish to
  white or pinkish white. <br>Male and perfect flowers present on the same plant,
  the male flower bearing 8 functional stamens, and a rudimentary gynoecium; perfect
  flowers with functional stamens and gynoecium; female flowers on separate plants,
  ovary bluntly trigonous; stigmas 3, finmbriate, androecium rudimentary.<br><br>The
