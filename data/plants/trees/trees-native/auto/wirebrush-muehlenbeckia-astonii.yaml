  '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Muehlenbeckia astonii is a shrub endemic New
  Zealand. It is a curious plant and very distinct from any other native New Zealand
  species. It is leafless in winter. It has a great number of fine reddish brown to
  reddish orange branches that zigzag with one another to form a dense ball, up to
  2 - 3 m. round. It has very small heart-shaped leaves (only a few millimetres) that
  grow in clusters of 2 or 3, or alternate along the longer branchlets.

  Flowers
  are tiny and grow in clusters of 2 to 4, less than 1 cm in diameter, greenish to
  white or pinkish white. 

  Male and perfect flowers present on the same plant,
  the male flower bearing 8 functional stamens, and a rudimentary gynoecium; perfect
  flowers with functional stamens and gynoecium; female flowers on separate plants,
  ovary bluntly trigonous; stigmas 3, finmbriate, androecium rudimentary.

  

  The
  fruit is about 3 to 4 mm in diameter, dark, three-angled nut, surrounded by the
  remnants of the flower.

  

  The plants in Taranaki have been planted as it is
  native to certain areas of North and South Islands. In the North Island known from
  Honeycomb Light (Eastern Wairarapa) south to Cape Palliser and just west of Sinclair
  Head. In the South Island in Marlborough formerly present on the Wairau Bar and
  Wither Hills, now known only from Clifford Bay, the lower Awatere Catchment to Cape
  Campbell and Kekerengu. Also in North Canterbury, on the Banks Peninsula near Lake
  Forsyth and on Kaitorete Spit. It occurs on the coast and on lowlands, forest margins,
  especially terraced riverbeds and rocky hillsides.
