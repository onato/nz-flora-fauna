description: 'The Yellow Pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa ''Aurea'') is a rare colour
  form. It is a coastal evergreen tree in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, that produces
  a brilliant display of yellow flowers made up of a mass of stamens. This yellow-flowered
  form "Aurea" descends from a pair discovered in 1840 on Motiti Island of Tauranga
  in the Bay of Plenty by a Mr Potts. This coastal tree can reach 20m in height.<br><br>Below
  is part of an article in the New Zealand Garden Journal, 2010, Vol. 13(1)<br>“M.
  excelsa ‘Aurea’: a greenish yellow-ﬂowered variant that originated on Motiti Island
  in the Bay of Plenty. It was ﬁrst offered for sale in a 1947 Duncan &amp; Davies
  Nursery Catalogue (no. 97). For many years Duncan&amp; Davies produced it from seed
  only and all seedlings remained relatively true to type with yellow ﬂowers (Hobbs,
  1992). Green (1975) incorrectly assumed that it was grown from cuttings to maintain
  its ﬂower colour. Metcalf (1987, 2000) states that all cultivated material is derived
  from two trees discovered on Motiti Island about 1940. Simpson (2005) states that
  naturally occurring yellow-ﬂowered variants are relatively common on Motiti Island.”<br>This
  yellow species of Pohutukawa is a taonga to the Maori, a valued treasure.<br><br><a
