  Avicennia marina ssp. australasica is New Zealand’s only species of
  mangrove and it is indigenous. New Zealand is the most southern mangrove growing
  country in the world. There are about 8 species of mangroves worldwide and their
  global distribution appears closely linked with the 20 degrees Celsius winter isotherm
  for seawater. However, the occurrence of mangroves in New Zealand is a notable exception
  to this. </p> <p>Avicennia marina ssp. australasica is a small yellowish-green tree
  or shrub of intertidal zones forming dense groves on coastal mudflats in the upper
  North Island. In New Zealand, they are found only in the top half of the North Island
  and grow in an area from near Cape Reinga in the north southwards to Bay of Plenty’s
  Ohiwa Harbour (near Opotiki) on the east coast and in the Kawhia Harbour on the
  west coast. This is north of about latitude 38 degrees south. Mangrove forests are
  made up of a number of different types of habitats - mangrove stands, pneumatophore
  zones, seagrass beds, low-tide channels, channel banks, and sandflats.
  
  Its growth
  habit is variable, as a tree form it can grow up to 12 m tall with a narrow to a
  broad spreading canopy; as a shrub form it will grow &gt; 2 m tall and &gt; 4 m
  across. The plant''s roots are spreading and they bear numerous erect pneumatophores
  (aerial roots).
  
  The leaves are leathery, tapering to a pointed tip and are a
  pale brown underneath. It has inconspicuous flowers which develop into large, yellowish,
  leathery fruit. These mangrove propagules (baby mangrove plantlets) fall from the
  tree and floating on tide till they are wash ashore and will then germinate.
  
  The
  bark on mature trees is grey and furrowed. The stout branches are spreading and
  brittle (snapping readily).
  
  Mangrove live in a salt water environment and exclude
  salt by having significantly impermeable roots which are highly suberised, acting
  as an ultrafiltration mechanism to exclude sodium salts from the rest of the plant.
  Analysis of water inside mangroves has shown 90% to 97% of salt has been excluded
  at the roots. Avicennia marina subsp. australasica can secrete salts directly from
  the leaves. They have two salt glands at each leaf base and they can be covered
  in white salt crystals.
  
  Mangroves provide an important habitat and nursery area
  for juvenile fish and crustaceans. The leaves, fruit and twigs that drop into the
  water are a source of food. The roots, pneumatophores (breathing roots) and overhanging
  branches provide shelter and protection from predators. Mangrove swamps protect
  coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during hurricanes), and tsunamis.
  The mangroves'' massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy. Likewise,
  they slow down tidal water enough so its sediment is deposited as the tide comes
  in, leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs. In this way, mangroves
  build their own environments. Because of the uniqueness of mangrove ecosystems and
  the protection against erosion they provide, they are often the object of conservation
  programs.

  ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. Why would mangroves have anything to do
  with our health and wellbeing?
  
  The coastal zone is dynamic and has many rivers
  and streams into large bays. Many bays and estuaries are exit points for sediment
  run-off from our mountains, rivers and urban environments which are carried down
  to the coast and out to sea. These sediments also carry a range of pollutants, mainly
  from industrial operations and road runoff.
  
  The presence of mangroves results
  in large amounts of sediment coming down from inland areas being trapped and bound
  together in a complex system of "roots" and pneumatophores. Mangroves provide a
  natural shelter belt along these areas of the coast, preventing the erosion of estuaries
  and the deposition of sediment out to the open coast.
  
  Mangroves form an integral
  part of our coast in the upper North Island and are part of the dynamic environment
  of these bays and estuaries. An absence of mangroves in large, intertidal shallow
  bays or estuaries affects how sandbars and other sediment types are formed in these
  areas.
  
  The trapping of all this sediment also binds up contaminants, both natural
  and man-made, "burying" them in the complex system that makes up mangrove "forests".
  Trace elements and other chemicals that are not readily available to enter the food
  chain and impact on wildlife and which can eventually enter our food chain accumulate
  in these sediments.
  
  Our own impact on the coastal environment contributes to
  both the accumulation of chemicals in the coastal environment and an extensive amount
  of additional sediment. Mangroves, in fact, assist in alleviating this problem if
  left where they are or assisted in recolonising areas affected by our own activities.
  
  Mangroves
  provide a refuge for a number of bird species. insects and invertebrates. Furthermore,
  mangroves are an important habitat for fisheries, contributing to juvenile fish
  population survival and recruitment into adult populations by providing shelter
  and a source of food. They provide a vital nursery ground for fish and a place of
  rest for migratory and pelagic fish.
  
  Mangroves grow in fine, silty mud along
  bays and inlets of the coast in northern New Zealand. They respire or "breath" through
  pneumatophores, or tube-like structures protruding through the sediment into the
  water column which is exposed at low tide.
  
  This complex root system binds up
  sediment, resulting in large areas of mud. Seed pods from mangroves drop off and
  are transported by tidal currents, colonising other areas of the coast where conditions
  are appropriate, giving rise to further mangrove forests.
  
  Estuaries are a dynamic
  environment, ever-changing as sandbanks shift and currents change direction. The
  ability of mangroves to adapt and change as the estuary changes it enables them
  to rapidly colonise areas.
  
  agriculture crops, forestry, sheep and dairy farming
  results in a lot of runoff from pastures. This runoff contains fertilisers, pesticides
  and herbicides, all of which affect animals which live in the estuaries or feed
  on those that occupy estuarine habitats.
  
  Furthermore, urban development and building
  along the coast result in further pollution loading into the coastal environment.
  Land reclamation also contributes to this, destroying large areas of mangroves,
  changing the environment and causing a shift in the distribution of mangroves.
  
  These
  effects can be divided into physical, chemical and biological, all having various
  effects on our coastal environment. It is our responsibility to mitigate or minimise
  these effects as we develop infrastructure to support our ever-expanding population
  base. Mangroves assist us in this process. So, rather than destroying them and not
  taking responsibility for our actions along the coast in such habitats, we should
  be mitigating our effects on these environments. The reason for this is that as
  mangroves bind up sediment in estuaries they also help bind up particulate matter
  and associated chemical pollutants such as trace metals.
  
  As a result of this,
  it is more difficult for these chemicals to enter the food chain. It also assists
  in limiting large amounts of sediment from being carried out to sea and deposited
  in areas that would otherwise not be exposed to this. This further limits potential
  habitat change and altering of ecosystems in ecologically sensitive areas of the
  environment.
  
  Not only are we protecting our marine environment through limiting
  the impact we have on estuaries and mangrove forests, but we are also protecting
  natural processes and protecting our fisheries, our environment and ultimately the
  food chain.
  
  As a result, we are protecting our health and well being. It is important
  for us to look after mangrove habitats around our coast without compromising land
  development.
