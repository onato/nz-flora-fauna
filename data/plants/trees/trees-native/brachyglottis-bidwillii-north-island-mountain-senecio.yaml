  Brachyglottis bidwillii forms a dwarf, slow growing, evergreen,
  compact shrub 30–90 cm high and a spread of 1.2m. The elliptic-oblong, shining dark
  green, leathery leaves are 1.9–3.8 cm long. The undersides of the leaves and stems
  are covered in white indumentum. 
  
  During January to February, it produces small,
  rayless flowerheads in panicles up to 5cm across in summer.
  
  Brachyglottis bidwillii
  is found in the subalpine scrub and fellfields of the central volcanoes of the North
  Island, New Zealand, and southwards to the Cook Straight. The variety Viridis is
  larger and is found in the South Island, where it is more common to the west of
  the Southern Alps.
  
  Brachyglottis bidwillii is frost hardy and can withstand temperatures
  down to -5°C.
