description: >
  Griselinia littoralis is native evergreen tree found throughout New
  Zealand in forests from sea level to 1000m, forming a dense bushy tree with
  deep green oval leaves. It grows up to 20 m tall, though often much less, particularly
  in coastal exposure. It can tolerate a wide range of conditions. The leaves are
  alternate, leathery, glossy yellow-green above, paler and matt below, 6-14 cm long,
  oval with a smooth margin.
  
  Griselinia littoralis produces male and female flowers
  on separate trees. They are borne on 2-5 cm long panicles, each panicle with 50-100
  individual flowers, Male flowers are about 5mm diameter; females about 3mm diameter
  and both have petals.
  
  The fruit is a small blackish berry and in time of food
  shortages, they were eaten, despite their bitter taste.
  
  Griselinia littoralis is in the same genus as Griselinia lucida Puka tree) which grows well in New Plymouth.
  Griselinia littoralis is more cold tolerant than Griselinia lucida.
  
  ## Traditional Maori use:
    
  It was an opening medicine and the
  inner bark was used on scrofula (a tuberculous infection of the skin on the neck) and
  venereal disease. (from "Medical notes of New Zealand NZ Med" by T.W.Bell 1890)
  
  The timber was known for its durability.
