  Phyllocladus toatoa (Toatoa) is a medium-sized conical or bushy, dioecious
  or monoecious native, endemic coniferous tree. It is found only in lowland forests
  in the northern half of the North Island. (On or N of the 39° S parallel). Its upper
  elevation limit is 600 m.

  It is a relatively slow growing tree that grows to
  about 15 meters in height and can have a trunk of 60 cm in diameter. The bark ranges
  in colour from dark brown to a silvery-brown.

  P. toatoa do not have true leaves;
  they have flattened branchlets called phylloclades (from Greek phyllo = leaf; klados
  = a shoot). P.toatoa is distinguishable from other species in the Phyllocladus genus
  due to its branchlets bearing two rows of phylloclades with toothed margins.

  The trees fruiting stage occurs during January to March. The female cones form on the
  edges of the phylloclades and are wind pollinated by male’s pollen. 

  P. toatoa produces a nut in a cup-shaped envelope. On maturity, each nut contains 3-4 3 mm
  black square shaped seeds. Mature seeds are dispersed from the cone through swelling
  of the cone bracts ejecting the seeds to the ground. This method is of distribution
  is limited resulting in many seeds landing on the ground under the female tree.
  Seeds are also spread to other areas by wind and birds.

  P. toatoa appears in
  the early stages of forest succession in areas where past logging of trees has occurred.
  It regenerates well in the shelter of manuka and kanuka scrub where its roots are
  partially shaded and its foliage is exposed to the sun.

  As with other lowland
  native tree species in New Zealand, there has been a historical decline due to logging
  and forest clearing for agriculture, which has now ceased. This species regenerates
  readily and under New Zealand’s policy of native forest protection that is now in
  place, the population has increased from the low numbers that were recorded in the
  1970s.

  The wood of P. toatoa is nearly white, straight grained and strong; it
  is was used for furniture, but being rare it is now protected from commercial exploitation.
