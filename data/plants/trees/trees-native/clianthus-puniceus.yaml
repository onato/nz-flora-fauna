  Clianthus puniceus the Kaka Beak tree is an
  endangered native tree of New Zealand. It is a woody legume shrub native to New
  Zealand's North Island. It is one of two species of Clianthus (Kaka beak), both
  of which have striking clusters of red flowers which resemble the beak of the Kaka,
  a New Zealand parrot. There is also a variety with white to creamy coloured flowers.
  
  This species is critically endangered in the wild, known only
  on Moturemu Island in the Kaipara Harbour. It was previously widely grown as a garden
  plant but has generally been replaced by the more robust Clianthus maximus.
  
  Kaka beak grows to around two metres high, with spreading branches
  producing leaf stalks up to 15 cm long bearing several pairs of small leaflets.
  They usually flower from spring through to early summer but can flower twice a year
  or even year round.
  
  Kaka Beak was used by the Maori to
  feed caged Tui. These native birds were kept in captivity to attract and capture
  other birds. The bright red flowers are held in groups from arching stems, well
  clear of the delicate fern-like foliage. Each flower holds copious nectar at the
  base of the flower attracting Tui &amp; other nectar loving birds. It flowers from
  early spring for several months.

  This Kaka Beak tree was photographed (August)
  from the footpath outside Te Kainga Marire Native gardens, Spencer Place. New Plymouth.
