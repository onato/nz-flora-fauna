description: >
  Coprosma acerosa is a low, spreading yellowish/green shrub that is native
  to New Zealand. It is a coastal plant found naturally throughout the North, South,
  Stewart and Chatham Islands, on the landward side of sand dunes. It forms a tight
  tangled mound of brown foliage. The yellowish leaves are narrow, small and have
  a dark line down the middle on the underside. They are in clusters of pairs scattered
  along twigs. The word ''acerosa'' used in the binomial name refers to the leaves
  and is from the Latin word ''acus'' meaning sharp or pointed. The bark is an orange
  colour.

  It flowers are tiny with long protruding threads. The fruit is a white
  berry.

  Coprosma acerosa is declining over large parts of its original range
  due to competition from marram grass (Ammophila arenaria).

  The Maori used
  a decoction of the bark and stems of the pikiarero (Clematis forsteri) and the root
  of the tātarahake (Coprosma acerosa) taken, ''slightly alternative'' (A medication
  that restores health). Colenso 1869.
