name: Coprosma acutiflora
description: >
  Coprosma acutiflora is a small tree growing
  up to 10 m. It is restricted to Raoul Island in the Kermadec group. It is now quite
  rare because it was eaten by wild goats but now the goats have been removed it is
  recovering.

  The yellowish green leaves (up to 7.5mm long and up to 3.5cm wide)
  have a wavy margin and taper to a point.

  Flowering occurs from autumn to winter.
  In spring to summer it develops orange-red berries.
