  Coprosma macrocarpa is a native tree that has two subspecies.

  Coprosma macrocarpa subsp. macrocarpa is the only one that attains tree size and its natural
  range is the Three Kings Islands. It ranges in size from a shrub to a 10m tall tree.

  Coprosma macrocarpa subsp. minor is mostly a shrub up to 4m, found in coastal habitats from
  North Cape to East Cape and some offshore islands.

  C. macrocarpa has large
  thick green leaves with recurved margins. Large bright red/orange berries (15-25mm
  x 10-12mm) form on female plants. These are the largest fruits of any species of
  Coprosma in New Zealand.
