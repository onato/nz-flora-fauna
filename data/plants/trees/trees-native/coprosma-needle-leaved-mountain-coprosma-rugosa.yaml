description: >
  Coprosma rugosa is a stiff erect native shrub
  with an orangeish tinge and grows up to 3 m tall. It has many interlacing wide-angled
  twigs bearing clusters of pairs of very narrow leaves (>14 mm long, >1.5mm
  wide). It forms extensive thickets in grasslands and forest margins in lowland to
  subalpine areas on moraines and river terraces. It grows in the North, South and
  Stewart Islands and is abundant in the mountains of Westland and Canterbury. C. rugosa
  has inconspicuous flowers which are followed by abundant small pale berries long
  into autumn. The seeds of the berries are widely dispersed by birds.
