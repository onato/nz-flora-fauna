  Coprosma rhamnoides is a tightly divaricating, native shrub (1-2m) with
  very small leaves. It is endemic to the North, South and Stewart Island. It is widespread
  in Canterbury and Westland in lowland to lower montane-scrubland and forest mostly
  as an understorey plant. It is less common higher in the montane zone.

  Coprosma
  rhamnoides has stiff interlaced reddish-brown barked branches and branchlets. Branchlets
  have fine hairs on them

  The leaves can be variously shaped from narrow to almost
  round, typically on the same bush but occasionally some plants have all the same
  shaped leaves.

  In October the plants develop small pale cream flowers which are
  dioecious (sexes separate). These flowers are wind pollinated. Drupes appear on
  the female plant in March-April small (3-4mm) red berries, turning dark red or black
  as they ripen

  The N.Z. flora has a large number of shrubs with small tough
  leaves and wiry interlacing branches â€“ divaricates. Some even have brown or grey
  new growth, giving a dead-like unattractive appearance. It is suggested that this
  may be a defensive growth mechanism to deter visits from browsing moa. Coprosma
  rhamnoides is a good example.
