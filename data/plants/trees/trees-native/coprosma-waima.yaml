  Coprosma Waima is a nationally endangered
  species of coprosma. This is a 1-3 m high erect shrub endemic to the Waima Forest
  in Northland where it grows in an altitude range of 640–760 m. Its habit is rock
  faces, steep south-facing slopes under forests of other native trees. It has one
  to several main stems each up to 40 mm in diameter, and the branches have a yellow-brown
  bark.

  It has large and oblong sessile (attached directly by its base without
  a stalk or peduncle) leaves which are 50–180 mm long, 30–70 mm wide and have a pale
  midvein on upper leaf surface.

  In autumn and spring flowers appear which are
  insignificant in appearance. After flowering 7–10 mm long orange-red colour fruit
  develop.
