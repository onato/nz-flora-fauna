  Many species are small shrubs with tiny evergreen leaves, but a few are small trees and
  have much larger leaves. The flowers have insignificant petals and are wind-pollinated,
  with long anthers and stigmas. Although flowering is usually in the spring months
  and fruit ripening in autumn, there is considerable diversity in the range of this
  species. Out of season, flowering may occur. 

  The fruit is a non-poisonous juicy
  berry, most often bright orange (but can be dark red or even light blue), containing
  two small seeds. It is said that coffee can be made from the seeds, Coprosma being
  related to the coffee plants. 

  The orange fruit of the larger species was eaten
  by Maori children, and are also popular with birds.

  A notable feature is that
  the leaves contain hollows in the axils of the veins; in these, and on the leaf
  stipules, nitrogen-fixing bacteria grow.

  The name Coprosma means smelling like
  dung and refers to the smell (methanethiol) given out by the crushed leaves of a
  few species.
