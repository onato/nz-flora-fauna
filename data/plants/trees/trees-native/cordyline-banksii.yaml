  Cordyline banksii is a monocot tree endemic to New Zealand. The species
  name banksii refers to the 18th-century botanist Joseph Banks. It is a sparingly
  branched cabbage tree can grow to 4 m tall. 

  It is seldom found in open ground
  and is often in scrub or deeper forest. Cordyline banksii tolerates a wide variety
  of habitats. It is common in coastal, lowland, and lower montane forests in the
  North Island, widespread in the northern half of the South Island and Westland as
  far south as Haast. 

  The leaves are lanceolate (somewhat paddle-shaped), up to
  2 metres long and from 40 to 80 mm wide. The leaves are broad in the mid portion
  and droop from there. A prominent flat midrib runs the whole length of the leaf.
  The fruiting panicle is up to 2 metres in length. 

  The flowers are white and
  pleasantly perfumed. The globe-shaped fruit is up to 5 mm in diameter, and are white,
  bluish-white, or blue. 

  When young it looks like a flax with its long drooping
  leaves, but after a few years it will grow a single trunk and adopt the cabbage
  tree form.
