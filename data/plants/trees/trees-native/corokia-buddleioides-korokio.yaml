description: >
  Corokia buddleioides is a much-branched shrub up to 3m tall.

  It is endemic from the Waitakere Ranges and the Coromandel peninsula northwards. It
  does not like to be exposed to harsh winds.

  The leaves of this shrub are long
  and slender with light green colouring with tints of brown and silvery-grey beneath.
  If growing in full sun the leaves are smaller and have more of a brown tint to them
  than the one growing in the shade.

  This shrub has hybridized with Corokia cotoneaster
  to produce many interesting forms. In spring it develops bright yellow star-like
  flowers about 10-15mm across which are followed in autumn by 6-7 mm dark red to
  black drupes. These fruits are eaten by birds.
