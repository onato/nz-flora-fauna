  Dracophyllum traversii is mainly a South Island
  dicotyledonous species, occurring in montane and subalpine heath forest and scrub
  above 750 m from Northwest Nelson to the central Southern Alps. It is also found
  on Mt Hikurangi in the Raukumara Range, in the Coromandel Range, and in scattered
  western localities between the King Country and Whangarei. It is growing at Pukeiti
  a very large public garden on the flanks of Mount Taranaki. It often dominates localised
  patches of forest, sometimes forming extensive stands along ridge crests. 

  Dracophyllum traversii is the longest living of our indigenous small trees up to 10 m tall, with
  individuals recorded at between 500 and 600 years old.

  The sparsely branched tree usually has a gnarled and spreading habit, with peeling bark on the trunk,
  and smooth, dark brown to almost black branches. The leaf colour varies from green
  to purplish-red and is a similar length to spiderwood, but a little wider with smooth
  margins. When the leaves fall they turn red-brown and persist for a long time on
  the forest floor. Their slow decay produces deep, slippery litter layers that prevent
  seedling regeneration. The long, stiff, gleaming leaves are used by Maori weavers
  for decorative features, such as tags on cloaks.

  Flowering is sporadic but when
  an individual tree can produce 750,000 1 mm long seeds. These tiny lightweight seeds
  are easily dispersed by wind. Despite this seed output, seedlings are rare, but
  this paucity is compensated for by the longevity of established plants.
