description: >
  Dracophyllum uniflorum is an erect, woody-stemmed, 1m tall, summer-flowering
  shrub with stout needle-like leaves. It is very common throughout the low alpine
  regions of New Zealand from the mid-North Island southwards. Its habitat is alpine
  shrub, herbfields and grasslands. Flowers appear January-March.

  It is called turpentine bush not because it has turpentines present but because of the ease with
  which this plant will burn even when green.
