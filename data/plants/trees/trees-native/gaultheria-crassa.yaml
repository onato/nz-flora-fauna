description: >
  Gaultheria crassa is a stout bushy shrub growing up to 1 m tall. It
  is dwarfed at higher altitudes. It inhabits mountains (700-1700 masl) from the Ruahine
  south.

  It has alternate shiny veined green leaves which are 10-15mm long by 5-7mm
  wide and are narrow- to broad- elliptic or suborbicular in shape. They are thick,
  leathery and rigid with toothed margins. The branchlets have sparse setose hairs.

  Gaultheria
  crassa is very floriferous having many small white bell-shaped flowers in 4cm long
  clusters at the tip of twigs during October to December. The white flowers develop
  into dried brown capsules in autumn.
