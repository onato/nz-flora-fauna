  and the liquid taken internally for all chest complaints. bronchitis, pulmonary
  tuberculosis and asthma. It was also said that it was a good blood cleanser, with
  a beneficial effect on the kidneys. The authors further report that Reverend Edgar
  Ward (1863 - 1934), who was also a qualified pharmacist; marketed a patent remedy
  called 'Kuranui' It was apparently made with Kumeraho, Koromiko and other unspecified
