name: Helichrysum lanceolatum (Niniao)
description: >
  Helichrysum lanceolatum is a common, widespread,
  variable, much-branched, small-leaved, native shrub. It occurs throughout New Zealand,
  especially in dry forest edge and scrub habitats. It grows from the Surville cliffs
  on the North Cape south to some lowland forests in the South Island. It can obtain
  a height of 2m. Its branches naturally arch over giving the shrub a weeping form.

  The leaves which alternate along the stem and are variable in shape, usually oval or
  rounded and some have small tips on the apex. The leathery leaves have buff-coloured
  tomentum on the under surface.

  In summer round clusters of small white flowers develop.
