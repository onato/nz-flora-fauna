  Hoheria angustifolia is a small, slender, grey-trunked tree of columnar
  habit growing up to 10-18 m tall. It can have a trunk diameter at breast height
  of up to 30 centimetres. It is endemic to New Zealand’s North and South Islands.
  It occurs in forests up to 900 m above sea level, mainly in drier eastern districts. 
  It is found mostly in the eastern South Island. It is absence from Taranaki, Auckland,
  Westland and Fiordland.

  Hoheria angustifolia is heteroblastic (growing several
  forms leaves depending on age) tree. A juvenile tree has slender, wiry, intertwined
  twigs branching at a very wide angle until it gets to about 2 m high. During this
  stage, it bears small roundish leaves.

  The grey-green to dark green adult leaves
  are narrow and have sharply-toothed margins and are &gt;48mm long by &gt;10mm wide.
  Occasionally different leaf-forms may all occur on the same tree.

  During December to February small clusters of starry creamy-white flowers (2cm across) smother the tree. 

  The flowers develop into dry papery winged fruits during February – April.

  Hoheria angustifolia is often an important host for Tupeia antarctica (white mistletoe).
