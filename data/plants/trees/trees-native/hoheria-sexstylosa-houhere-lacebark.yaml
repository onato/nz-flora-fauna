description: >
  Hoheria sexstylosa is a species endemic to New Zealand. It is a fast-growing
  evergreen tree growing to 8 tall by 6 m broad. It has steeply ascending stems and
  branches. The smaller branches become drooping or even pendulous as the tree matures
  give the tree a graceful weeping habit. It has deeply incised, serrated evergreen
  leaves which are 3-15 cm long and 2-5 cm wide. The foliage is very variable on young
  plants, being ovate or rounded and variously lobed or toothed. Adult leaves are
  alternate, lanceolate, acuminate, glabrous, dentate, light glossy green above and
  paler on the undersides.

  In late summer and autumn, it develops white scented,
  star-shaped flowers which are up to 2.5cm across and displayed in 2-5 flowered cymes
  in the leaf axils. The flowers have 6 pinkish styles hence its Latin name “sexstylosa”
  which means "six styles". The developed fruit has wings which are coloured red to
  pink appear about May.

  Distribution in the North Island is from Waikato and the
  Coromandel Peninsula south to Wellington, while in the South Island natural populations
  appear to be in North West Nelson, inland Marlborough and Banks Peninsula. There
  may be other populations that are naturalised. 

  The bark was traditionally used
  by the Maori and early European settlers in New Zealand to make rope and its white
  timber was used in cabinet-making.
