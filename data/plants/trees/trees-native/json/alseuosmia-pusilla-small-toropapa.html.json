  "description": "Alseuosmia pusilla is a small slow growing endemic shrub that only grows in cool semi-shaded sites that have permanently damp soil. It will grow to 0.6 m in height and can have a spread of 0.3mm.\\<br>It is found in the North Island from Te Moehau and Mt Pirongia south, mainly montane. It grows on Mt Egmont/Taranaki. In the South Island, it is found in the west only from North-West Nelson to near Okarito.<br>The glossy leaves often have a mottled red-flecked surface and the margins are entire or can have a few minute teeth.<br>In November to March, it develops white fragrant sweet smelling flowers whose petals are sometimes fused into long tubes.<br>Bright shiny red fleshy fruit appears January to March.<br><br>Alseuosmia pusilla looks a lot like a juvenile Pseudowintera colorata (horopito) whose leaves have a peppery taste. They are completely unrelated. Itâ€™s been suggested that this is a case of mimicry, the palatable Alseuosmia pusilla mimicking the unpalatable Pseudowintera colorata, although this is controversial. Alseuosmia flowers and fruit are very different to Pseudowintera colorata.<br><br>The name is derived from the Latin words. Alseuosmia meaning perfume grove and pusilla meaning small.<br><br><a href=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/0754/Alseuosmia_pusilla.JPG\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/0754/Alseuosmia_pusilla.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a> <br><br>Small shrub photographed East Mt Egmont/Taranaki February.<br><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/0739/Alseuosmia_pusilla2.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"> <br><br>The red juicy fruit.<br><img src=\"http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/0744/Alseuosmia_pusilla3.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"><br><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
