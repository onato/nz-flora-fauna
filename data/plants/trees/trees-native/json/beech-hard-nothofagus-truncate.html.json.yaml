name: Fuscospora truncata.
description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Fuscospora truncata is a species of tree endemic
  to New Zealand. Its common name hard beech derives from the fact that its wood has
  a high silica content, making it hard and difficult to saw. <br>Hard Beech is a
  tree up to 30m tall occurring in lowland and lower montane forest from lat. 35°S
  to 42°30''S, that is, from the north of the North Island to Marlborough and south
  Westland in the South Island. <br>In north Taranaki hard beech occupies much of
  the rugged sandstone country, forming almost pure stands.<br>It is partly deciduous
  in late winter/early spring. The coriaceous (leathery) ovate hairless glossy leaves
  range from 2.5 to 4 cm long and have from 8 to 12 pairs of coarse blunt teeth. There
  are no domatia (small depressions partly enclosed by leaf tissue or hairs) on the
  under surface of the leaf. Its trunk has bark that is thick, furrowed and a slate
  grey. <br>It develops lots of tiny red male bell-shaped flowers. Clusters of 3 flowered
  female are on stalks. The green-brown tipped flowers are between the leaves and
  stems.<br>The wood is red when cut and it dries to light brown. It is harder than
  other beeches. Its bark full of tannin and was used for leather tanning. The woods
  past uses were for bridges, posts, poles and railway sleepers.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><a
