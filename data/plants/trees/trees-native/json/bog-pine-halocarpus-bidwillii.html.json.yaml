name: Halocarpus bidwillii
description: 'Not in Taranaki<br><br>This native conifer species is named after John
  C. Bidwill, alpine plant fancier, who collected in New Zealand in 1839 and 1848.
  Bog pine is a common spreading or erect bushy shrub of subalpine and alpine areas
  forming scattered populations on North and South islands. Its range in New Zealand
  is from Cape Colville on the Coromandel Peninsula to Stewart Island; usually at
  600-1,500 m elevation in the north but coming nearer to sea level in the south.
  It is a hardy plant, growing in both bogs and dry, stony ground, usually in montane
  to subalpine scrub. It is not in Taranaki. McGlone (1980) outlined the history of
  the vegetation history of Mt Taranaki based on the results of pollen analysis and
  examination of plant fossils. He found that 18,000 years ago Halocarpus was once
  growing on the mountain.</p> <p class="MsoNormal">As its name suggests, it grows
  in bogs, but it is just as likely to be found on well-drained, stony ground. It
  is a spreading or erect, closely branching shrub, or occasionally a small tree up
  to 3.5 m tall, with a short trunk up to 38 cm in diameter. Sometimes the horizontal
  branches form roots as they grow, giving rise to a ring of "shrubs" around the parent.
  Thus develops an extensive mini forest with the appearance of a huge, low-spreading
  tree or shrub. The parent tree may die, leaving its circlet of outliers intact and
  flourishing. The bark is thin, reddish. <br>Branches give rise to densely arranged
  branchlets which are seldom upturned at their tips. Branchlets are covered with
  small scale-like leaves.<br>Adult leaves are 1-2 mm long, scale-like, appressed
  and overlapping on the stem. They have no raised ridge (keel) or hardly so except
  near thickened leaf tips.<br>The tips of adult branches often revert to juvenile
  foliage. Juvenile leaves are 5-10 mm long and 1-1.5 mm wide, spreading all around
  the stem, stiff but not prickly. The change to adult is abrupt.<br>Pollen cones
  - Pollen cones, 3-5 mm in length, are solitary at branchlet tips.<br>Mature berry-like,
  seed cone has a white aril surrounding the single 2-3 mm long seed encased in black,
  leathery skin (the epimatium tissue, derived from the ovule-bearing bract). A fleshy
  white cup derived from an outgrowth of the epimatium surrounds the base of the seed.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Photo taken at the scientific reserve at "The Wilderness" near
  Lake Te Anau has excellent examples growing in stony ground. These trees are slow
  growing and some of the threes in the photos are 200 years old.<a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0002/1874/bog_pine__Halocarpus_bidwilli_-2.JPG"
