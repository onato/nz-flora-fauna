name: Coprosma rhamnoides
description: 'Coprosma rhamnoides is a tightly divaricating, native shrub (1-2m) with
  very small leaves. It is endemic to the North, South and Stewart Island. It is widespread
  in Canterbury and Westland in lowland to lower montane-scrubland and forest mostly
  as an understorey plant. It is less common higher in the montane zone.<br>Coprosma
  rhamnoides has stiff interlaced reddish-brown barked branches and branchlets. Branchlets
  have fine hairs on them<br>The leaves can be variously shaped from narrow to almost
  round, typically on the same bush but occasionally some plants have all the same
  shaped leaves.<br>In October the plants develop small pale cream flowers which are
  dioecious (sexes separate). These flowers are wind pollinated. Drupes appear on
  the female plant in March-April small (3-4mm) red berries, turning dark red or black
  as they ripen<br><br>The N.Z. flora has a large number of shrubs with small tough
  leaves and wiry interlacing branches â€“ divaricates. Some even have brown or grey
  new growth, giving a dead-like unattractive appearance. It is suggested that this
  may be a defensive growth mechanism to deter visits from browsing moa. Coprosma
  rhamnoides is a good example.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/4914/Coprosma_rhamnoides_Twiggy_coprosma_-004.JPG"
