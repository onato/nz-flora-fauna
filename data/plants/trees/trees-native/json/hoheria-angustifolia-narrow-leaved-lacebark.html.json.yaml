description: 'Hoheria angustifolia is a small, slender, grey-trunked tree of columnar
  habit growing up to 10-18 m tall. It can have a trunk diameter at breast height
  of up to 30 centimetres. It is endemic to New Zealand’s North and South Islands.
  It occurs in forests up to 900 m above sea level, mainly in drier eastern districts.
  It is found mostly in the eastern South Island. It is absence from Taranaki, Auckland,
  Westland and Fiordland.<br><br>Hoheria angustifolia is heteroblastic (growing several
  forms leaves depending on age) tree. A juvenile tree has slender, wiry, intertwined
  twigs branching at a very wide angle until it gets to about 2 m high. During this
  stage, it bears small roundish leaves.<br>The grey-green to dark green adult leaves
  are narrow and have sharply-toothed margins and are &gt;48mm long by &gt;10mm wide.
  Occasionally different leaf-forms may all occur on the same tree.<br>During December
  to February small clusters of starry creamy-white flowers (2cm across) smother the
  tree. <br>The flowers develop into dry papery winged fruits during February – April.<br>Hoheria
  angustifolia is often an important host for Tupeia antarctica (white mistletoe).<br><br>Photographed
  late February the tree is covered in dry papery winged fruits.<br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0012/3983/Hoheria_angustifolia__1_.JPG"
