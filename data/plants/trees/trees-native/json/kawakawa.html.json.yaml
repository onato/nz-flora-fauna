description: '<p style="display: inline !important;">Kawakawa is a small tree in which
  the subspecies P. excelsum subsp. excelsum is endemic to New Zealand; the subspecies
  P. e. subsp. psittacorum is found on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and the Kermadec
  Islands.</p> <p>It is endemic to the North and South Islands and is common from
  te Paki south to about Okarito, North Canterbury and the Banks Peninsula.</p> <p>It
  can be found growing from coastal areas to lowland (extending up 500 m. a.s.l. in
  warmer parts of the country). It is usually an important understorey species in
  coastal forests. The New Zealand''s subspecies is a small, densely branched, aromatic,
  dioecious tree with large heart-shaped fleshy leaves growing up to 5 metres.<br>It
  has tiny flowers which are on upright catkin-like spikes and occur on separate male
  &amp; female plants. <br>The fruit which is only on female trees (2 to 5 cm) long
  is a whole lot of little fruit clustered on a central stem, green at first but changing
  to orange when ripe The seed in the soft, orange spikes that are a favoured food
  of many birds in late summer and are dispersed by them.. </p> <p style="display:
  inline !important;">The root, fruit, seeds and especially the leaves of the kawakawa
  plant were favourite medicinal remedies of the New Zealand M훮ori. In fact, the kawakawa
  is one of the only plants still used by the Maori people today. Externally, Kawa
  Kawa was used for healing cuts and wounds, as an ingredient in vapour baths, and
  also as an insect repellent. Internally, it was found to be effective as a blood
  purifier in cases of eczema, boils, cuts, wounds, rheumatism, neuralgia, ringworm,
  itching sore feet, and all forms of kidney and skin ailments. The leaves were chewed
  to alleviate a toothache. The bruised leaves drew pus from boils and skin infections.
  A drink made from the leaves helped stomach problems and rheumatics when rubbed
  on joints. The leaf, if dried and burnt is an insect repellent.</p> <p style="display:
  inline !important;"> The name kawakawa in Maori refers to the bitter taste of the
  leaves. </p> <p style="display: inline !important;"><br>kawakawa is also used by
  the M훮ori for ceremonies, including removing tapu, and as a symbol of death, a garland
  of greenery worn by women at tangihanga.<br><br>The leaves are often covered with
  insect holes due to damage by Kawakawa looper moth caterpillar (Cleora scriptaria,
  Family: Geometridae).See photo below.</p> <p><img src="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0001/1249/Macropiper_excelsum___Kawakawa-1.JPG"
