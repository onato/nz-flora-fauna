description: '</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Hoheria populnea is a very fast growing floriferous
  (bearing flowers) branched native shrub or small tree, growing to up to 11m in height
  and it is a colonising plant in open areas.<br>It is found naturally in lowland
  forests found in the north and west of North Island, Three Kings Is, Great Barrier
  Is, and on the Kermadec Is but is now planted in gardens and parks throughout New
  Zealand.<br>It has evergreen oval pointed leaves with serrated edges up to 12 cm
  in length.<br>It develops abundant white scented flowers in late summer/autumn.
  <br>These flowers are 2cm across white and scented and are borne in cymose clusters
  of 5-10 flowers in late summer and autumn. The flowers have 5, or rarely 6, styles.
  The calyx is campanulate (shaped like a bell), with triangularly toothed sepals.
  Each flower gives rise to 5, or rarely 6, seed pods, which are broadly winged.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The bark was used by the early Maori, and also the early European
  settlers, as a source of fibre, particularly for use as cordage. The timber was
  used for furniture making.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0005/4789/Hoheria_populnea__Lacebark.JPG"
