description: 'Melicope simplex is a shrub (&gt;5+) native to New Zealand. It is found
  throughout New Zealand in the margins of coastal and lowland forests to 600 metres
  AMSL. This small tree or low twiggy shrub had slender, tangled branches and smooth
  brown trunk up to 10cm in circumference.<br>Juvenile leaves have three leaflets
  (5-10mm x 3-10mm), adult leaves are small, thick, leathery and nearly circular (1-2
  cm long) with margins that have shallow rounded teeth. The somewhat flattened leaf-stalk
  has a "joint" across it. The underside of the leaves has visible oil glands. The
  leaves when crushed have an aromatic citrus smell.<br>M. simplex develops greenish
  white flowerheads in spring which are male or bisexual (5mm long). In summer to
  autumn it develops dry wrinkled capsules with four lobes. Each lobe produces 1 shiny
  black seeds.<br>Melicope simplex hybridises with Melicope ternata. This natural
  hybrid use to be called Melicope mantelli by is now correctly called Melicope simplex
  x ternata. See page. <a href="friends-of-te-henui-group/table-1/melicope-simplex-x-ternata-hybrid.html"
