name: Pseudowintera colorata
description: 'Pseudowintera colorata is a species of small, woody evergreen flowering
  shrub part of family Winteraceae. The species is endemic to much of New Zealand.
  It is abundant in upland and mountain forests in the North Island and extends down
  to sea level. It grows up to eight metres in height. The upper surface of its light-green,
  elliptical leaves is often splotched with red, especially if the plant is exposed
  to sunlight. The leaves undersides are a blue-grey colour. <br>Tiny greenish-white
  flowers appear in early spring, followed by black berries in autumn. The berries
  are very palatable to birds.<br><br>Pseudowintera colorata is continually exposed
  to attack by various insects and parasites and its occurrence in high rainfall areas
  makes it particularly susceptible to attack by fungi. This has led to efficient
  built-in defence mechanism of a compound called Sesquiterpene dialdehyde polygodiali
  which has anti-fungal properties. Pseudowintera colorata leaves and an extract from
  the leaves are now used in a number of commercial antifungal products based on the
  results of scientific research. <br>The characteristically sharp, hot peppery taste
  of a leaf when chewed is primarily due to these polygodial compounds which cause
  pungency on the tongue in concentrations as low as 0.1 µg. Ground up leaves are
  used as a condiment in ethnic foods. As the leaves taste bad to deer and stock and
  are not eaten, this shrub often dominates the understorey vegetation in heavily
  browsed forests.<br><br>Maori uses: Horopito has long been used by the indigenous
  Maori population of New Zealand both internally and externally for many purposes.
  As far back as 1848, Horopito is documented in the treatment of skin diseases such
  as ringworm, or for venereal diseases. “The leaves and tender branches of this shrub
  are bruised and steeped in water, and the lotion used for ringworm; or the bruised
  leaves are used as a poultice for chaffing of the skin, or to heal wounds, bruises
  or cuts". Infection due to Candida albicans (Maori – Haha, Haka) is documented as
  being a major cause of death of Maori babies, due to their being fed an "unsatisfactory
  diet." The juice of Horopito leaves was placed straight in the mouth, or alternatively,
  leaves were steeped in water to extract the juice and this decoction was used in
  the treatment of what we now understand as oral thrush (candidiasis). Early European
  settlers to New Zealand also used Horopito for medicinal purposes. For internal
  use, leaves were either chewed or prepared as a tea. "The leaves and bark are aromatic
  and pungent; the former is occasionally used by settlers suffering from diarrhoeic
  complaints." A decoction of the leaves was taken for stomach ache and was known
  as "Maori Painkiller" and "Bushman''s Painkiller." There are accounts of the bark
  being used in the 19th century as a substitute for quinine: "The stimulating tonic
  and astringent properties of which are little inferior to winter''s bark.". A French
  nun, Mother Aubert, went to live among the Maori at the end of the 19th century,
  and the native plant remedies she later created became commercially available and
  widely used throughout the colony of New Zealand. Horopito was one of the two ingredients
  in her patent medicine, Karana. In a letter to the French Consul dated 2 December
  1890, she described it as "superior to Quinquina [quinine] in the treatment of chronic
  stomach sickness. It has been very useful to me in cases of anaemia of debility,
  of continuous diarrhoea etc and in recovery from temperatures".<br><br>This tree
