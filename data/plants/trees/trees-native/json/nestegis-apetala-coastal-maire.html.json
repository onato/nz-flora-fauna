  "description": "Nestegis apetala is a small tree native to the North Island mainland on rocky headlands around Whangarei Heads and at the Bay of Islands. It is also found on northern offshore islands including the Hen and Chickens Islands, Great Barrier Island, Little Barrier Island, and the Poor Knights Islands. It is also on Norfolk Island. The species name apetala refers to the lack of petals on the flowers.<br>Nestegis apetala is shrub or tree up to 6 m tall, with smooth, shiny dark green leaves 4.5 to 12 cm long and 1.5 to 4 cm wide. Juvenile leaves are larger, up to 14 cm long by 8.5 cm wide. The leaves are often wavy, and are borne on leaf stems about 10 mm long. The flowers of N. apetala arise in racemes of up to 21 flowers growing from the leaf axils or directly from the branchlets. The individual flowers are each about 2.5 mm in diameter, and lack petals. The fruit is a drupe 9 mm long, red or yellow, less commonly purple when ripe.</p> <p><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Trees/1-NestegisApetala.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"> <br><br>The fruit.<br><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Trees/1-fruit%20CoastalMaire.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Trees/1-fruit%20CoastalMaire.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a> <br><br>Leaves of a young plant.<br><a href=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Trees/1--NestegisApetala%20young.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"uploads/images/Te%20Henui/Trees/1--NestegisApetala%20young.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\"></a> <br><br>Thanks to Wikipedia for text and information: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/%20\" target=\"_blank\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ </a></p> <br style=\"clear:both;\"> <div class=\"hr\"> </div> ",
