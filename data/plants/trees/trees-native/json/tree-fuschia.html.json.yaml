description: '</p> <p>Fuchsia excorticata, the New Zealand Fuchsia also known as Kotukutuku,
  is a New Zealand native tree belonging to the family Onagraceae forming a tree to
  15 metres with a trunk to 0.6 metres in diameter. It is found commonly throughout
  New Zealand and as far south as the Auckland Islands. It grows from sea level up
  to about 1,000 m, particularly alongside creeks and rivers. <br>Fuchsia excorticata
  is considered to be the world’s largest fuchsia. It is one of New Zealand’s few
  truly deciduous trees, losing its leaves in winter in all but the warmest areas.
  <br>Attractive, small flowers appear between August and December. They change from
  greenish-yellow to purple-red.These flowers are rich in nectar and are visited by
  honey-eating birds, especially tūī, bellbirds and silver eyes. The dark purple berries,
  known as kōnini by Māori, are edible and taste like tamarillos.</p> <p>Fuchsia excorticata
  are easily recognised in their native environment by the characteristic appearance
  of their bark, which peels spontaneously, hanging in red papery strips to show a
  pale bark underneath. The introduction of Common Brushtail Possum to New Zealand
  has precipitated a serious decline in this species where large concentrations of
  the possum are present. Kotukutuku appears to be one of the possum''s preferred
  food sources and they will browse individual trees to the point of defoliation and
  the trees will die. <br><br>The berry (konini) is sweet and juicy and it was also
  used by European settlers to make jam and puddings. Tui and wood pigeon feed on
  the berries which have lots of very tiny seeds. Fruit is edible and tastes like
  a very mild grape. Maori called the fruit konini and the name is sometimes given
  to the tree.<br><br><a href="http://ketenewplymouth.peoplesnetworknz.info/image_files/0000/0007/1654/Fuchsia_excorticata__Tree_Fuchsia_.JPG"><img
