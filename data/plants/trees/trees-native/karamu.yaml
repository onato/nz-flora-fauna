  Karamu is the Maori name given to the tree Coprosma robusta and Coprosma
  lucida, two of the 45 Coprosma species found in New Zealand. Coprosmas are identified
  by the domatia (tiny holes at the junction of the veins on the underside of the
  leaf), their stipules, small flowers and colourful berries. 

  Coprosma robusta is found in lowland forest or shrub throughout New Zealand and almost to the south
  of the South Island. It has dark green leaves approximately 5-13cm long and 3-4
  cm wide. The centre vein of the leaf is not raised on the top surface. The main
  vein is raised on the under surface. The tree itself is either a shrub or small
  tree that can grow up to 6m tall. The stipules have a single, shiny black gland
  at the tips. 

  Coprosma robusta produces masses of orange berries in late Summer.
  When berries are present, they are 8-9mm long and can take up to a year to ripen.
  Birds enjoy the masses of orange fruit on female plants.
