  Kermadec pohutukawa (Metrosideros kermadacensis) is an evergreen dominant
  tree of the myrtle family which is endemic to the volcanic Kermadec Islands which
  are more than 1,000 kilometres north-east of New Zealand (NZ territory). It has
  been widely planted in mainland New Zealand, where it grows as a compact tree up
  to 15 metres tall with a trunk is up to 1 m or more in diameter. It has smaller,
  rounder leaves than New Zealand pohutukawa, and flowers sporadically through the
  year.
