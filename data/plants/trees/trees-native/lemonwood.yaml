description: >
  Whilst young a Pittosporum eugenioides has a conical shape that broadens
  and spreads with age to 20m in height, the largest NZ Pittosporum. The trunk of
  60cm is encased in the bark. The small yellow flowers which appear from October
  to December grow in terminal clusters and have a pleasant smell. The leaves are
  yellow-green with undulating margins and a lemon scent can be smelt if crushed.
  Naturally occurring throughout NZ from sea level to 600m.
  
  The Maori used the gum from the bark in complex scent formula along with parts of other plants.
