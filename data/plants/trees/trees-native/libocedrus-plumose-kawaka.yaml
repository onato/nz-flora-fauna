  Libocedrus plumosa is a species of conifer endemic to New Zealand, occurring
  on the North Island in lowland and hill forest near Te Paki and to the south of
  Kawhia in the west and Gisborne in the East. It also grows in the north of the South
  Island near Nelson (41° S). It is classed as at risk as it needs disturbed areas
  to regenerate. 

  It grows from sea level up to 600 m.a.s.l in temperate rainforests.
  This evergreen coniferous tree grows to 25 m tall, with a trunk up to 1.2m in diameter.

  The bark tears off in long thin strips which often spiral gradually around the
  trunk, giving the tree a twisted appearance. The foliage is arranged in flattened
  sprays; Libocedrus plumose has closely overlapping scale leaves arranged in four
  rows of opposite pairs at right angles to those above and below.

  Libocedrus plumose
  and Libocedrus bidwilli are unique among New Zealand conifers in having small seed
  cones made up of a few thin woody scales. The male and female cones occur at the
  tips of twigs on the same tree. Male cones are 3–5 millimetres long and contain
  about 10–14 scales. They are produced in spring to early summer.

  The female cones
  are reduced to four large green scales, two sterile and two fertile. When ripe the
  tiny, dry woody cones split open to release two winged seeds, which are dispersed
  by wind. 

  In the past, it was selectively milled to near extinction for its
  red wood which was used for house shingles and in cabinet making.
