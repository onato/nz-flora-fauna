  Black maire (Nestegis cunninghamii) is
  a tall handsome canopy tree with a stout straight trunk growing up to 23 m high.
  Now found only in isolated North Island forests. The long leaves are leathery but
  smaller in adult trees. Black maire has dense, even-grained timber, dark brown in
  colour and often streaked with black and is very hard. The bark is rough and corky.
  Red fruits (sometimes yellow) are profuse, giving the tree a bright yellow glow.
  Maori used it for digging sticks and mallets, and as wedges for splitting wood.
  In the 1900s boatbuilders also favoured black maire timber for their mallets. Black
  maire burns slowly with great heat, and between the 1920s and 1960s most accessible
  stands were felled for firewood. The timber was also used for framing railway carriages
  and machinery, and building bridges, flooring, weatherboards, some furniture In
  recent years windfallen or recycled maire is used it has been used for wood-turning
  and specialist items such as golf-putter heads and woodwind instruments.
