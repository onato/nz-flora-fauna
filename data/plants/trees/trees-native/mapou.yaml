  Myrsine australis is a species of shrub within the family Myrsinaceae.
  It is endemic to New Zealand and found throughout the country and offshore islands.
  It has crinkly-edged leaves which make it easily mistaken for a pittosporum and
  reddish bark and stems. Growing to around 6 metres in height, it inhabits bush margins.
  The bark on a mature trunk is grey. Mapou produces small black fruit in summer (popular
  with birds) these grow directly on the stem of the plant, not at the end of branches
  and twigs.

  Maori boiled mapou leaves to make an infusion (tea) for a toothache.
  They also used the leaves as relief for arthritic problems, as a remedy for skin
  disease, intestinal worms and as a general tonic. The branch wood was used for digging
  sticks and adze handle sockets.
