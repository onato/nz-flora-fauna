  Pachystegia insignis is a native species of flowering plants in the
  daisy family, Asteraceae. It is a compact, low-growing shrub up to 0.9m tall naturally
  occurring on steep rocky hillsides in coastal and mountain situations only in Marlborough.
  Pachystegia insignis is highly resistant to summer drought conditions with their
  thick leathery leaves, dense felt like tomentum on the undersides and on young stems
  help to retain water.

  This rock daisy is common throughout eastern parts of Marlborough.
  It is most plentiful along the Kaikoura coast where it can be seen growing off many
  of the steep rocky bluffs or stony sites composed of sandstone gravels. The local
  rock types have a relatively high level of natural fertilizer especially calcium
  bound phosphorus (Ca. P).

  Pachystegia have large dark green leathery glossy leaves
  7.5–17.5 cm long which have a heavy felting of silvery, white tomentum (*a covering of closely matted or fine hairs*) on the upper surface when
  young, becoming deep green and glossy with age. The mature leaves are shiny green
  above and are clothed in a thick white or light brown tomentum beneath. 

  In June to August, the immature flower heads start as felt drumsticks and then bear daisy-like
  solitary white flower heads, up to 75mm across, with yellow centres. Fluffy seeds
  follow. 

  At present, 3 species are recognised in the genus. Pachystegia insignis,
  Pachystegia minor and Pachystegia rufa all endemic to New Zealand. Pachystegia insignis
  is by far the most common and widespread within the genus’s natural region which
  as the common name suggests is Marlborough. There it is found from the Wairau River
  in the north and to the south to the Waiau River in North Canterbury and inland
  as far as Molesworth Station. The other two species, P. rufa and P. minor are also
  found growing within this range but are confined too much smaller areas. It is thought
  that P. rufa is only found in four small gullies all in close proximity. Pachystegia
  insignis hybridises readily with Pachystegia rufa, creating a variety of intermediate
  forms.
