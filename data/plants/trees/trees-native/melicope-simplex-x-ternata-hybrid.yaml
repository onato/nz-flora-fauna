description: >
  New Zealand's two species of Melicope, Melicope simplex and Melicope
  ternata naturally hybridises in the wild. This natural hybrid use to be called Melicope
  mantelli by is now correctly called Melicope simplex x ternata. These two closely
  related Melicope look completely different than each other and when hybridising
  can produce a range of variants.

  This loose entity consists of a spectrum of
  forms, some resembling Melicope ternata more closely, while others are very close
  to typical Melicope simplex.
