name: Melicytus alpinus (Porcupine shrub)
description: >
  Melicytus alpinus is an almost leafless slow-growing native shrub of
  coastal and/or dry alpine areas of the southern North Island and the South Island.

  Melicytus alpinus has stiff interlacing stems and it will grow to a dense shrub up to 1m high
  and 2m wide. It gets its common name because the external branches looking very
  much like the silvery quills of a porcupine. The bulk of the leaves are held within
  the canopy, an adaptation that helps decrease heat and drought stress in extreme
  climates. This resilient species is one of the last bastions of native vegetation
  in the heavily modified landscapes of the South Island high country.

  In spring to early summer it produces amongst its small weather resistant leathery leaves
  masses of tiny pendulous cream flowers followed by relatively sizeable blue-splashed
  white berries.

  M. alpinus is a habitat for native lizards which return the protection
  it provides by helping disperse the seeds by eating the fleshy berries.
