name: Melicytus chathamicus (Chatham Island mahoe)
description: >
  Melicytus chathamicus is a small, common tree that grows up
  to 6 m tall. It is endemic to several of the Chatham Islands. It is a major component
  of the dwindling coastal forests.

  It has large, oval, green, leaves that are
  up to 12 cm long and the margins are toothed. The leaves stalks can be either green
  or bright red colour.

  Melicytus chathamicus is a dioecious tree having male and
  female flowers on separate plants. Yellow flowers which appear during spring are
  small. Small fruit can be present September to April. They can be purple with a
  white fleck or they can be entirely a dark purple colour.
  
  Melicytus chathamicus is now grown in New Zealand as an informal boundary hedge, with typical hedge height:
  2-3m. Since it is growing in the Chatham Islands it tolerates cold, windy, coastal
  conditions.
