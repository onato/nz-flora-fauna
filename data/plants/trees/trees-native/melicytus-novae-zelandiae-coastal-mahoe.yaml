description: >
  A small dioecious shrub growing naturally along New Zealand’s
  northern coast from the Bay of Plenty northwards. It grows mainly on the coastal
  offshore islands. It grows up to 1 – 2m tall and is multi-stemmed with an upright
  growth habit. The olive green leaves tend to be leathery with serrations that are
  rounded.

  During August to September, it has small yellowish green bell-shaped
  flowers. The female plants produce numerous ovoid white shaded berries spotted with
  very dark purple from late August to October.</p> <p>Melicytus novae-zelandiae is
  reported as being entomophilous (Webb et al. 1999), but later research shows indications
  of wind pollination as well. It is now thought to have dual (wind- and animal-)
  pollination. It has substantially higher pollen: ovule ratios than the animal-pollinated
  plant species.
