description: >
  Myrsine aquilonia is a dioecious, suckering
  shrub or small tree up to 12 m tall with an erect and spreading, crowded branching
  habit. Aquilonia means northern, referring to the natural distribution of coastal
  matipo, which is found on Rauhomaumau Island, in Tutukaka, Rangaunu Harbour, and
  Te Arai in the far north of New Zealand. It is scarce on the mainland, however,
  and is found most abundantly on the Poor Knights Island group where it is often
  the co-dominant species in the main vegetation types. 

  Adult leaves (12­28 x 10­17 mm) are thick, dark green, and semi-glossy with a rounded or obtuse apex with
  a shallow notch. Tiny green flowers appear in August followed by circular purple
  or violet drupes in December – January.

  Myrsine aquilonia can be purchased from specialised nurseries.
