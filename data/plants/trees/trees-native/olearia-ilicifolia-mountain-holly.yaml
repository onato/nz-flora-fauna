description: >
  Olearia ilicifolia is an evergreen, much-branched spreading large shrub
  or small tree, reaching 5 m high. 

  Its stiff shiny grey-green narrow, spear-shaped
  leaves are 5â€“10 centimetres long with undulating and prickly-toothed edges. The
  underside of the leaves has a yellowish to white closely pressed tomentum. 

  The small daisy flowers which appear late spring to mid-summer are white with yellow
  centres and grow in large terminal corymbs. 

  Olearia ilicifolia is found in lowland
  to subalpine forest, and scrub from sea level to 1,200 metres in the North Island,
  South Island and Stewart Island. It is growing on Mt Egmont/Taranaki.

  It is closely related to the sub-alpine Olearia macrodonta, with
  which it shares the names Mountain Holly and New Zealand Holly, however, it is much
  more common than Olearia macrodonta. 

  Olearia ilicifolia growing on the side
  of the Oaotit Stream, private land next to Mt Egmont Reserve, South Taranaki. 370
  masl. Late December
