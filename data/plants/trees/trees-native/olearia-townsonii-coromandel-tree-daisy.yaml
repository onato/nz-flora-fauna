description: >
  Olearia townsonii is a shrub or small tree up to 5 m. tall.
  It has stout angular branches that are dark reddish brown when young. The leaves
  (7-16cm x 3-5cm) are thick and leathery and have a thin silvery grey-white tomentum
  on the underside.

  Large inflorescences of white flowers with 12-20 flowers per
  flowerhead appear on long stalks. The white flowers (10mm in diameter) which are
  fertilized by insects appear during summer and the seeds that have parachute hairs
  are wind dispersed during autumn.

  Olearia townsonii grows only in the North Island
  from the Coromandel Peninsula to Wanganui, generally only found on sedimentary hill
  country cliffs, banks and shrubland. Except for the Coromandel, it is absent in
  the east of the North Island.
