  Olearia traversiorum is a rapidly growing hardy tree endemic to the
  Chatham Islands (New Zealand). It is a common tree of the lowland forests and is

  This olive-like tree has a tall
  narrow growth form growing to a height of 18m and has a trunk up to 1 m wide. Yellow
  flowers appear late spring and into summer and fruits appear from January to June.

  This threatened species is now sold in specialised nurseries.
