  Pachystegia rufa is one of three species of Pachystegia, all endemic
  to New Zealand. The others are Pachystegia insignis and Pachystegia minor. They
  are all found in the Marlborough region. Only a small population of Pachystegia
  rufa remains in the wild. Pachystegia insignis is the most common species.

  Pachystegia rufa is a species of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is a dwarf,
  robust, spreading, evergreen shrub growing to a height of 1 m and to a width of
  1m. The shrubâ€™s stout branches are covered with brown hairs. 

  It has large, leathery, oblong, dark green, shiny leaves which are smaller than those of Pachystegia insignis.
  The leaves are crowded towards the ends of the branches. They are a shiny, deep
  green on top with an undersurface that is clad with a thick tomentum. 

  In spring it has large white daisy-like flowers with a yellow disc in the centre. 

  When Pachystegia rufa is brought into close association with Pachystegia insignis it
  readily hybridises creating a variety of hybrids.
