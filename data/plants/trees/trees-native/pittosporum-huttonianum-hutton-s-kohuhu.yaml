description: >
  Pittosporum huttonianum is a small tree with spreading branches forming
  an open habit and growing to about 10m in height. It has brown to grey-black bark.
  It is endemic to Great Barrier Island and the Coromandel Peninsula. It is also present
  in the western Waikato from Raglan to Marokopa in the North Island. It grows from
  coast to montane areas up to 700m. It is common in regenerating forest, or along
  ridge lines, on cliff tops, along slip scars, rock tors and in limestone country
  fringing razorbacks and dolines (tomo) shafts. 

  The mature leaves are large and
  leathery are up to 12 cm long and 5 cm wide. The young new growth branchlets, leaves,
  some flower parts and buds are at first covered with floccose white, white-grey
  to faintly fulvous tomentum with pale hairs. The base of the leave's midribs is
  sometimes reddish.

  Flowering occurs October - November and they are 1cm in diameter
  and are a very dark red. The 1.5- 2 cm fruit capsules are present throughout the
  year. 

  Taxonomic Notes from NZPCN. "In parts of its range, this species appears
  to grade with P. colensoi and P. tenuifolium. Many botanists informally regard P.
  huttonianum as a subspecies of P. tenuifolium. Further research into its status,
  perhaps by using an appropriate range of molecular markers might clarify its status.
  NZPCN retain the species because for most of its range it is a well-marked species
  and in that range, it is often sympatric with P. tenuifolium."
