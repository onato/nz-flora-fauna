description: >
  Pittosporum divaricatum is a much-branched shrub 2–3.5 m. high and a
  metre or more in diameter. In the shade, there is often a short trunk, but at other
  times there are several more or less erect or spreading main stems, branching from
  the ground or near it; in other cases, the bush is fastigiated (Having erect and
  almost parallel branches tapering toward the top). The principle stems give rise
  to numerous ascending branches, more or less interlacing, and terminating in a mass
  of divaricating branchlets. Branchlets rather long and sometimes pendulous at the
  tips, free and not interlacing, often arising in whorls of three or four, but also
  singly thinner and less rigid than in P. divaricatum. Young branchlets have numerous
  white appressed hairs.

  The flowers are fragrant, 5–7 mm in long inflorescences.
  The 5 sepals are a pale straw colour. The 5 petals are 4–5 mm long and are dark
  purple. They have 5 dark purple stamens. The tips of the anthers reach the top of
  the corolla tube.
  
  Hugh Wilson & Tim Galloways book "Small-leaved Shrubs of New Zealand." states: "Pittosporum lineare Laing et Gourlay
  1935 is not considered to be specifically distinct from P. divaricatum. It was said
  to differ in its narrower, less dimorphic leaves (nearly all smooth-edged not toothed
  or lobed) and in its darker bark. Forms such as this are found in both North and
  South Islands within the range of more typical Pittosporum divaricatum. "
