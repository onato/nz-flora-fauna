description: >
  Pittosporum obcordatum is a divaricating shrub up to 8 m tall with slender
  grey to reddish-brown, numerous, interlacing branches that become tightly interlaced.
  These branches cover the tree down to the ground so the trunk is not usually visible.

  The leaves (up to 10 mm long and wide) are short and broad and rounded with
  an irregular margin and sometimes a notched tip giving the leaf a heart shape. 

  Fragrant white flowers develop late September to early December. 

  The 5-10 mm seed capsule
  appears December to May but fruit on well-established plants may be found at any
  time of the year. 

  Pittosporum obcordatum is endemic to the North and South Islands
  mainly in eastern areas Awanui south to the Wairarapa in the North Island and in
  the South Island now known from several sites in the Catlin west to Lake Manapouri.
  It is a species of primary lowland alluvial forest, favouring sites prone to summer
  drought being otherwise waterlogged and frost-prone during winter.
