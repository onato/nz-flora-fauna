  cattle.

  Solanum laciniatum is a perennial hairless shrub to 3 m high and
  is a common urban weed in many parts of the country. Solanum laciniatum is indigenous
  to the North, South, Stewart and Chatham Islands. It is also present in southeastern

  5 notched petals. The conspicuous drooping sprays of berries are yellow to orange-yellow,
  succulent, egg-shaped and 10-18 mm across. The stems are hairless, often striped
