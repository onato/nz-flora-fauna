name: Pseudopanax discolor
description: >
  Pseudopanax discolor is a much branching native
  shrub that can grow up to 5m. It has 3-5-foliolate (compound leaves) on the ends
  of long stems. There are also single leaves present. The leaves upper margins have
  large pointed teeth. The leaves are usually green but sometimes they can have a
  bronze-green colour especially on the undersides.

  The leaves of P. discolor are
  smaller than that of P. arboreus (which usually has 5 leaflets). Pseudopanax colensoi
  var. ternata also has three leaflets but these are larger and thicker than P. discolor.

  There are male and female trees.but only the female has female flowers while the male
  tree can be bisexual.

  Its natural habit is the northern areas of the North Island
  of New Zealand.

  It is now sold by specialised nurseries so it now can be found
  growing outside its natural habitat.
