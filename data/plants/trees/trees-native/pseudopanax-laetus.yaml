description: >
  An uncommon spreading shrub or small tree with a maximum height: 5 metres
  it is found naturally in the North Island from Coromandel to Taranaki in forest
  margins and open scrub in sedimentary hill country. It is mostly epiphytic on tree
  ferns or on cliffs as a result of goat browsing.

  It has 5-7 leaflets (leaflets
  12-25cm x 5-10cm) with reddish coloured stalks (up to 25cm long) and midveins. The
  leaves have serrated margins.

  The bark has yellow grooves running down the stem.
  In spring it has small red berries (5mm). The plant is very palatable to goats and
  possums.
