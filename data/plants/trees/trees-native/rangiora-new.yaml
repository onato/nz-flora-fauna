  Rangiora is endemic to New Zealand. It grows to a height of 5 to 7 metres
  and is common in scrub and forest throughout the North Island and upper South Island.
  A bushy shrub with large leaves, which are dull green on the upper surface. The
  leaves are between 5-25 X 5-20 cm broad with lobed margins. The petioles of the
  leaves have a characteristic groove up to 10 cm long. The undersides of the leaves
  are white with a soft furry underside. These leaves have been referred to as "Bushman''s
  toilet paper. They also make a practical paper on which letters have been written.
  It has fragrant creamy flowers that are abundant in spring. The flowers are found
  on much-branched panicles with each floret being about 5mm in diameter X 12mm long.

  The seed are ripe when tiny 'parachutes' are formed after flowering (Oct/Nov), these
  are then blown from the plant.by the wind. 

  Maori used the plant for a number
  of medicinal uses. The leaves contain a small quantity of an alkaloid poison which
  has some antiseptic quality and was used for wounds and old ulcerated sores to keep
  dust and flies away. The bark and tips of the branches on the west side of the bush
  were cut and the gum which exuded was chewed (but not swallowed) for foul breath.
  The leaves were bruised, mixed with olive oil and applied to boils as a poultice.

  plant is also poisonous to stock, causing "staggers".
