  Raukaua edgerleyi is a (10 m) native tree
  with ascending branchlets and a trunk (40cm diameter) with pimply cream to pale
  grey rough bark. 

  Raukaua edgerleyi is scattered and infrequent in the North
  Island from Kaitaia southwards and also in the South and Stewart Islands. Its habitat
  is lowland to montane forests, often as epiphytes on tree ferns and grows from near
  sea level to 900 m. a. s. l. 

  The adult aromatic shiny green leaves (7-15cm x
  3-5cm) are long-oval and are not serrated but have wavy margins. The juvenile leaves
  are deeply incised on the margins and have pale green to reddish brown undersides.
  

  Small 3-4mm star-shaped greenish flowers appear during September to December.
  Round fruit 3-4cm in diameter develop from October to March but some fruit may be
  present throughout the year.
  
  The leaves of which were used
  by the Maori to produce a scented oil which has a fresh green aroma. In an early
  publication describing the flora of New Zealand, Kirk (1889) wrote “The Raukawa
  is prized by the Natives on account of its perfume: Mr Colenso states that they
  rub their limbs and bodies with the fresh leaves and I have been informed that the
  leaves are also used for scenting oil. It seems probable that the perfume might
  be extracted and form a profitable article of commerce.”
