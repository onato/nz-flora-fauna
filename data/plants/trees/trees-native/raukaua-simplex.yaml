  Raukaua simplex is a small much-branched evergreen monoecious native
  tree (?8m) endemic to the North, South, Stewart and Auckland Islands. In the
  North Island, it grows from the Coromandel south. It is present on Mt Egmont/Taranaki.
  Its habit is lowland to montane forests (>1400 m.a.s.l).

  The juvenile leaves (3-5-foliate) have deeply incised leaflets with up to 6 pinnate segments and are 4-15 cm long and 1-2cm wide.

  The adult leaves (1-3-foliate) are 5-10cm long and 1.5-4cm wide. 

  The leaves are on long red stalks. Small green/yellow flowers are followed by flattened fruit (white with purple specks).
