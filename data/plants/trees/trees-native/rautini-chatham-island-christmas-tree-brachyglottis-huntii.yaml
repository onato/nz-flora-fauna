  Brachyglottis huntii is a large tree daisy that grows up to 8 m tall.
  Is it grows well on moist, peaty soils. It is found on stream sides and ridge crests
  in forests, shrubland and drier swamps on the Chatham Islands.

  It is numbers are now restricted on Chatham Island itself, but is still widespread on Pitt Island.
  Its conservation status is ‘nationally critical’, due to habitat destruction, which
  includes browsing and trampling by cattle, sheep, pigs and possums.

  The bark is flaky and the leaves are 70-180 mm long and 20-40 mm wide. They densely clad
  in downy hairs, giving the whole plant a silvery hue.

  It produces brilliant yellow globes of florets in summer, these set as dense masses of wind-dispersed seed.
