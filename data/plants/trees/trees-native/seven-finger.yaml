  Schefflera digitata is a tree endemic to New Zealand. It is a small,
  spreading tree up to 8 m high with stout branches. 

  It occurs in lowland to lower
  montane forests from sea level to 1200 m in the North Island, South Island, and
  Stewart Island, covering a latitudinal range from 34°S to 47°S. It prefers damp,
  shady parts of the forest and is common along stream banks and on shady forest roadsides.
  It is the only New Zealand representative of the genus Schefflera which has 200
  species of shrubs and small trees in the tropics and subtropics.

  The leaves may have from three to nine leaflets. The leaflets are thin and soft to the touch with
  sharply serrated margins. In the north of the North Island, S. digitata has a juvenile
  stage in which the leaflets are divided into irregularly toothed lobes.

  The late summer inflorescences are large, multi-branched panicles up to 35 cm across, with
  umbels of small greenish flowers arising at irregular intervals along its length.
  Each umbel contains up to ten flowers each about 7 mm in diameter. The ripe violet
  to black fruits is fleshy, round, and grooved when dry. They are about 3.5 mm in
  diameter and take two or three months to ripen. These are an important food source
  for many of the native birds. 

  The sap of the tree has medicinal uses and has
  been used to treat ringworm and sores on the skin. The wood was used by Maori to
  make fire by friction.

  Seven-finger is the most common host of the parasitic
  plant Dactylanthus taylori. This is a root parasite which was known to the Maori
  as 'Pua-o-te-reinga', 'the flower of the underworld' or by Europeans; Wood rose.
