description: >
  Gaultheria antipoda is an erect or spreading evergreen shrub, which
  grows up to 1–2 m tall. It is native to lowland and montane forest, scrub and rocky
  places in the North, South and Stewart Islands of New Zealand.

  It has leathery, shiny, alternate leaves that are round with bluntly serrated edges. The leaves are
  5–15 mm long, dark green, shiny above and they have a network of veins on both surfaces.

  In November it develops lots of small, white, bell-shaped flowers, singly at the leaf
  axils. The leaves on the branch tips are much reduced in size. (See photo of flowers
  below)

  The flowers are followed by juicy white, pinkish, red, 10 mm fruit that
  ripens from late summer to autumn. The berry-like fruit is a swollen fleshy calyx
  that encloses a thin many-seededcapsule. They are edible but are rather insipid.

  The early Maoris use to scrape the leaves and applied it to cuts as it has soothing
  and healing properties.
