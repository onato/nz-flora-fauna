  Like all Solanum species, Solanum aviculare leaves
  and unripe fruits contain quantities of toxic spirosolane alkaloids, including solanine
  and solanidine.  

  Solanum aviculare is a fast-growing, short-lived, shrub native
  to New Zealand and the east coast of Australia. In New Zealand, it is found on the
  Kermadec Islands, North Island, the northern South Island and Chatham Islands of
  New Zealand. It grows in coastal and lowland forest margins and in shrubland.

  Solanum aviculare is an upright shrub that can grow up to 4 m tall. It has a soft-wooded
  trunk and branches that persist for several years and become straggly with age.

  There is much confusion between this species and Solanum laciniatum. Solanum aviculare
  has smaller flowers than Solanum laciniatum whose flowers are a darker purple and
  have broad, flared (ruffled) corolla lobes with rounded apices and larger seeds
  that are 2–3 mm long.

  Solanum aviculare leaves are 8–30 cm long, lobed or entire, with any lobes being 1–10 cm long.

  Solanum aviculare has white, mauve to blue-violet
  flowers that are hermaphroditic (having both male and female organs). They are 25–40
  mm wide and are followed by ovoid to ellipsoid berries that are 10–15 mm in diameter.
  They are first green changing to bright orange colour when ripe. The seeds 1-1.5
  mm long, light brown or reddish-brown.

  There is a number of subspecific taxa in New Zealand within Solanum aviculare. (G. Forst)
