description: >
  Sophora molloyi is a bushy spreading to decumbent kowhai that is usually
  wider than high (3m) and is endemic to New Zealand. Specimens growing at Otari Wilton
  Reserve have reached 6m. It grows in the North Island and South Island near Cook
  Strait and on some Cook Strait Islands. Its habitat is in coastal scrub on exposed
  maritime sites. Unlike another kowhai, S. molloyi retains its leaves all year round...
  It has historically been sold as Sophora. ‘Dragon’s Gold’.

  Its yellow flowers are small than other Sophora species at 3cm and appear from April to October.
