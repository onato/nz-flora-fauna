  The name Metrosideros means “iron-hearted”
  (from the Greek metra= middle and sideros = iron referring to the hardness of the
  timber, umbellata meaning “bearing umbels” an umbrella-shaped group of flowers originating
  from a single stem.

  This is a shrub or tree up to 15 m tall or more that starts
  off on the ground. The trunk grows up to 1 m or more in diameter and is covered
  in a pale papery bark that peels off in strips. Southern rata has long pointed leaves
  that are very shiny on the upper surface. The leaves are longer than those of the
  Northern rata, but more closely resemble Northern rata than pohutukawa. The young
  foliage is a pleasing brown or purple in colour and the tree puts on a spectacular
  display of crimson flowers. An occasional yellow-flowered specimen can be found
  in Otira and Westland. Young leaves and branchlets are silky to the touch. The seed
  capsules are bigger than those of Northern rata. The timber is very similar to that
  of Northern rata and used in the same way.
