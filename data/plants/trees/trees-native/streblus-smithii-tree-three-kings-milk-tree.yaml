description: >
  Streblus smithii is endemic to the Three Kings Islands north
  of New Zealand. A small tree up to 5 m tall with a spread of up to 4m. It has leathery >16 cm 
  long leaves with smooth margins. The bright green leaves are attached
  alternately along the stem. The lower surface of the leaf is slightly paler and
  has prominent veins.

  A pair of long tapering stipules is found on either side
  of each leaf stalk.

  The small unisexual flowers are crowded into 5-12 cm long
  spikes. The female flower consists of 4, green-purple hair-covered tepals surrounding
  an ovary with two feathery stigmas at its top. After flowering small red and fleshy
  fruits (drupe), 8-9 mm in diameter is formed.

  The bark exudes a thick white (milk-like)
  sap when cut hence its common names.
