  Beilschmiedia tawa is a New Zealand
  broadleaf tree common in the central parts of the country. Tawa is often the dominant
  canopy species in lowland forests in the North Island and northeast of the South
  Island. Individual specimens may grow up to 30 metres or more in height with trunks
  up to 1.2 metres in diameter, and they have smooth dark bark. Its leaves are willowy
  green and paler underneath.

  Beilschmiedia tawa produces small inconspicuous flowers
  compared to the 2 - 3.5 cm long fruit of a dark red plum colour. With such large
  fruits the Tawa is notable for the fact that it relies solely on the Kereru (New
  Zealand Woodpigeon) and, (where present), the North Island Kokako for dispersal
  of its seed. These are the only remaining birds from New Zealand's original biota
  large enough to eat the fruits of this tree and pass the seeds through their guts
  and excrete them unharmed.

  The Maoris use to soak, dry and pulp the fruit for food. 

  Tawa can also support significant epiphyte gardens in their canopies,
  which are one of the few habitats known to be frequented by the enigmatic, arboreal
  striped skink. It is one of the few hardwood trees in the country with good timber,
  the wood of this tree can be used for attractive and resilient floorboards, panelling
  and doweling. Although largely protected in conservation areas and by robust environmental
  legislation, licences are occasionally granted for the odd fallen tree to be milled
  for its timber. The Maori used it for making bird spears.
