description: >
  Tetragonia implexicoma is a prostrate or scrambling, succulent, subshrub
  that is indigenous to the coast of New Zealand, Kermadec (Herald Islets, Raoul,
  Macauley Islands), Three Kings, North, South, Stewart and Chatham Islands. It is
  also present in Australia, the western Pacific, Malesia, Japan and southern South
  America. When growing in the coastal strand zone it often found along beaches amongst
  driftwood and seaweed but also in sand dunes, on boulder and cobble beaches, on
  cliff faces and rock ledges. In New Zealand, the species is highly variable and
  some populations, notably those from the Kermadec and the Three Kings Islands have
  rather smaller leaves and with a more compact growth habit.

  Tetragonia implexicoma
  is a trailing perennial herb that forms dense patches of interlacing branches. Branches
  can reach 1m in length and are coloured red or pink when young, maturing to dark
  green to brown-black and becoming woody. 

  The alternate, often clustered, fleshy,
  bright to dark green or yellow-green leaves are ovate-rhomboid to triangular. The
  thick succulent leaves are edible with a similar flavour and texture to spinach.

  During September-June small, solitary or paired, yellow daisy-like flowers develop on short
  stalks. Flowers are followed during September-July by succulent, &gt;8 mm long edible,
  pink to dark red berries.
