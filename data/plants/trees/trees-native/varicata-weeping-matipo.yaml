description: >
  Myrsine divaricata is a small evergreen, bushy shrub, with spreading,
  drooping branches, which can grow to 7m high and have a trunk up to 40cm in diameter.
  The drooping branches give rise to woody interlacing (divaricating) branchlets bearing
  solitary leaves or leaves in groups (fascicles). 

  The small leathery leaves are 7–12 mm long broad, heart-shaped and are strongly notched at the tip and have with
  thickened margins. Solitary leaves are arranged alternately along the stem. The
  leaves in fascicles are attached to short side branches, with thickened margins.
  Oil glands appear as dots scattered within the leaf blade but especially prominent
  at the margins. A distinguishing feature is a dark blotch at the base of each leaf.

  Tiny flowers, with pale yellow or red petals, occur singly or in clusters. 

  Small 4-5 mm in diameter fleshy fruits (drupes) is formed. 

  Myrsine divaricata is endemic in lowland to higher montane forests and shrublands, in North Island (from latitude
  35° southwards), South Island, Stewart Island, Auckland Island, and Campbell Island.
  It is present on Mt Egmont/Taranaki at an altitude where the shrubs become smaller
  and more compact.
