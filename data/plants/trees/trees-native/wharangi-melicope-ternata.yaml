description: >
  A New Zealand round coastal shrub was once known for its edible gum.
  Melicope ternata yields an edible gum that was used for chewing as it sweetens the
  breath for halitosis sufferers. It is growing in the coastal forests of New Zealand.
  It has aromatic lime green glossy trifoliate leaves. Two species of Melicope are
  the only members of the citrus family to be present in New Zealand. As with other
  members of this family, both Wharangi (Melicope ternata) and Poataniwha (Melicope
  simplex) emit a pleasant scent (from oil glands) when the leaves are crushed.

  Small yellowish green scented flowers develop in early spring followed by brown capsules
  each with 4 small pods containing one black shiny seed from late spring to late
  summer. These are eaten by birds. 

  This shrub is slightly frost tender and grows to about 5m in height.
