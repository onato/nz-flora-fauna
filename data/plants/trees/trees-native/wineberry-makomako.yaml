description: >
  The tree, called makomako in Maori, is common throughout New Zealand
  in damp disturbed forest margins and damp river edges. It can be classified as a
  shrub or small tree and can grow to 10m. 

  Wineberry is a dioecious tree or shrub
  with male and female individuals; male and female flowers arise on separate plants,
  so both sexes are required for the production of red-black berries. Its leaves are
  broad, rose-coloured leaves and grow 5-12 cm long with a long petiole. It flowers
  September to December producing small rose coloured flowers 4mm wide. It develops
  edible berries which dark red to black and 5mm wide containing 8 seeds. These berries
  ripen in January to February and are dispersed by birds.

  The bark of branchlets
  green or red in colour, darkening with age. Leaves, flowers and buds are very palatable
  to possums.

  Maori children used to feast on the berries, which were also squeezed
  and strained to make a sweet drink.

  European settlers made jam and jellies and
  also produced a very good wine from the berries Infusions from the bark and leaves
  were used to treat a burn, boils, sore eyes and rheumatic pains.
