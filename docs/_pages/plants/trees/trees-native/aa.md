Coprosma atropurpurea is a dioecious evergreen low mat-forming sub-shrub found in alpine areas. It grows in lowland to higher montane regions in sandy and gravelly soils in tussock grass, stream margins, rocky places and dry river beds on North and South Islands. It has an altitude range up to 1720 m. It grows to a height of 0.1m and a spread of 0.5m. The leaves narrowly elliptical and are glossy bright green and sometimes are red to purple tinted. It has male and female flowers from July to August. Since the plant is dioecious both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. The flowers are pollinated by the wind. The berries are translucent and a deep reddish purple colour.
