Brachyglottis hectori is a much branch shrub or tree which grows up to 4m tall. It grows on lowland to mid-montane areas of limestone and marble in northwest Nelson to north Westland.

Its flowers (5cm) are white with yellow centres and appear during summer. Seed heads follow flowering. The seeds are dispersed by wind. The flowers can have 8-12 ray florets.
It has large leaves with toothed margins with lobes at the base. The undersides have a fine tomentum.
The name Brachyglottis comes from the Greek words brachus meaning "short" and glottis meaning "the vocal apparatus of the larynx". The name Hectorii is after Sir James Hector, 19th century New Zealand geologist and botanist who was originally from Scotland.
