title: Brachyglottis greyi (Daisy Bush)

---
Brachyglottis greyi is a New Zealand native broadleaf evergreen shrub which grows up to 1.5 metres tall and 1.8 metres wide. Its leaves are alternate, simple and oblong to ovate-oblong, 4 centimetres to 8 centimetres long and 2.5 centimetres to 4 centimetres wide with wavy margins. They are green above and have a white down underneath, giving the silver-grey appearance and a felty texture. This hair protects the plant from the desiccating in hot growing conditions.

In January it develops bunches of lemon yellow daisy-like flowers (3cm) across, with conspicuous ray-florets, and are produced in large terminal corymbs which cover the shrub. 
Brachyglottis greyi habit is primarily a coastal species growing on rock outcrops and bluffs but may extend inland up river gorges and in suitably exposed bluff habitats. It is endemic only to the southern North Island from near Flat Point south to the mouth of the Orongorongo River.
There is a group of Brachyglottis greyi hybrids from Brachyglottis greyi, Brachyglottis laxifolia, and Brachyglottis compacta. These are misidentified in gardens and nurseries as Senecio greyi or Senecio.
