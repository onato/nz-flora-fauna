It forms a stout tree up to 8 m tall, with a trunk from 40 to 80 cm in diameter. The stem is usually unbranched or has very few branches. The leaves are 1 to 2 metres long, and from 10-15cm wide, a blue-green and are shaped like a broadsword. They have conspicuous midrib which is often tinged red, orange-red or golden. Dead leaves forming a skirt at the base of the tuft.
