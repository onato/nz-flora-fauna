Cordyline obtecta is indigenous to New Zealand and Norfolk Island. Found naturally on the Three Kings Islands (North East Island, Manawa Tawhi (Great Island), South West Island and West Island), North Island (North Cape and Murimotu Island), Poor Knights Islands (Aorangi and Tawhiti Rahi). 

Cordyline obtecta is a widely branched tree up to 6 m tall. Its trunk can be solitary or multi-trunked from the base and has a rough fissured bark. The inflorescence is a broad densely flowered panicle. The white or yellowish flowers form spring and early summer and are and are sweetly scented. The glossy white to purple seeds appear in autumn and are 4mm  in diameter, with a deep notch on one side.
Derivation of name: 
Cordyline - derived from the Greek word kordyle, meaning club and refers to the enlarged underground stem or rhizome.
obtecta - relates to the Latin word obtegere, meaning to conceal or cover up, alluding to the flowers that scarcely protruded beyond the leaves of the first plant described.
