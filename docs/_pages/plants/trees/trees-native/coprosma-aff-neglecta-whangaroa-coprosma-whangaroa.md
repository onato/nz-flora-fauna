Coprosma aff.neglecta whangaroa is a gently mounding shrub and is one of a number of closely related forms that grow in far-flung parts of Northlandâ€™s coastline. It is endemic to the base of andesite breccia cliffs on the northern side Whangaroa Harbour and in Pekapeka Bay a small islet on the just inside the harbour entrance.

Coprosma 'Whangaroa' grows to about 1+ m tall and has elongated, ascending stems. Its small, dark green leaves are oval or spherical in shape.
It is dioecious meaning it has male and female flowers on separate plants. The male and female flowers develop on the branchlets during spring. The female flower has two long cream stigmas, while the male flower has four filaments that are each topped with an anther.
About April the female plants produce 5-6 mm dupes that are a dark red or black in colour. They each contain 2 seeds.
