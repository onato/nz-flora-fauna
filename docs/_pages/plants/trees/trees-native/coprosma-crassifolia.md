Coprosma crassifolia is a rigid, glossy, dark green, bushy shrub growing up to 4 m tall found in lowland forests of North and South islands. Its habitat is coastal, lowland and lower montane shrubland, scrub and forest with an altitude range up to 610 meters. In the forest, the shrub is sparsely branched but in the open, it forms densely branched thickets. </p> <p class="MsoNormal">The stiff, more or less round remote leaves and the stiff, red-brown branchlets distinguish C. crassifolia from all other Coprosma species. The flowers are unisexual. The berries flesh is transparent but look white due to the white seed within. They may also look pale yellow.
