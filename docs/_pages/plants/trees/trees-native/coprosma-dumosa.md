Coprosma dumosa is an erect shrub found throughout New Zealand in lowland forest to penalpine scrub (from 1100m). C. dumosa is most abundant on valley floors and in stream gullies. Rare in northern New Zealand but becomes increasingly common to the south. Very common in most parts of the South Island but is rare in Fiordland. It is found on Mt. Egmont/Taranaki. 

It flowers October to January and fruiting occurs February to April. The fruits are usually translucent white but rarely pink, yellow, orange or red.
