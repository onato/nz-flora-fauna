Coprosma propinqua is a New Zealand plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family and the genus Coprosma. It is a small-leaved shrub or tree which grows 3 to 6 metres high. Mingimingi has divaricating branches, and is common in swampy forest, scrub, along stream banks and in stony places. It has a wide distribution throughout New Zealand and grows from sea level to 460 metres.

The male flowers of C. propinqua occur in axillary clusters of one to four on very short branches. 
Female flowers are found on their own at the ends of short branchlets. Flowering occurs between February and March. Pollination is by the wind.
The fruit is a drupe, pale when immature, turning dark blue or blue-flecked when mature.
C. propinqua freely hybridizes with C. robusta.
