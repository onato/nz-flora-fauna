Coprosma parviflora is a small-leaved divaricating shrub (2-5 m) that is native to New Zealand and occurs naturally on the Three Kings Islands and in the northern North Island from Te Paki south to Kaipara Harbour in lowland forest, scrubland and swampy ground.

It is a shrub with greyish bark, divaricating branches and small variable thick leathery leaves (7-12 mm long) which occur on short hairy petioles. In some plants, the leafy branches form more or less flattened planes. (See photo below)
The flowers are minute and appear August to October. The drupes, about 5 mm in diameter, ripening in late summer/ early autumn are either yellow/white or dark purple.
