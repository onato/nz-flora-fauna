Coprosma petriei is a mat-forming shrub native to New Zealand.

It sometimes forms large dense flat mats amongst grasslands and in herbfields and rocky areas in alpine and subalpine areas. It is an extremely rugged species and will survive in extreme places such as the short grasslands of the Mackenzie Basin or on the exposed rocky ground in montane areas.
It is a dense matting plant with rich green leaves but in some extreme conditions, they will exhibit a brownish-green colour. It is a wind-pollinated plant and the plants only produce either male or female seeds, they are not self-fertilizing.
