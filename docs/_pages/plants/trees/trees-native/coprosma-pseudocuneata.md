Coprosma pseudocuneata is an erect open-branched variable shrub up to 3 m tall with stout branches. Its habitat is subalpine scrub and shrubland and is found from the Raukumara range in the North Island of New Zealand south as far as Stewart Island at an altitude range of 240–1525 m. On Mt Taranaki/Egmont it is found in subalpine scrub and shrubland from 1100 to 1400 metres above sea level.

The dense foliage can be dark green with long narrow leaves or yellow-green with short broad leaves. It has solitary light yellow flowers from December to January and its fruits appear February till May. The oblong 5–6 mm long fruits are usually red, orange-red, orange, pale purple, pale yellow or yellowish white.
