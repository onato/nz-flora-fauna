Coprosma rotundifolia is a native forest shrub of New Zealand. Its found on the North Island from about Kaitaia south, South and Stewart Islands in damp lowland forests and especially on alluvial soils. It can grow up to 6 metres tall with divaricating branches. These wide-angled branches bear pairs of small (15-25mm long x 10-20mm wide), rounded leaves that are covered in small hairs. The leaves often have purple-blotches on them and they can taper to a small sharp tip. Veins are evident on both sides of leaves.

The flowers are dioecious (male and female flowers are on separate trees). The female flowers are seated in the green calyculus which is formed by the fusion of two stipulate bracts. The petals above are joined with the 2 female translucent stigmas rising above. They are pollinated by wind.
Coprosma rotundifolia produces orange or red fruit (4-5 mm in diameter) on very short stalks. The fleshy fruits have two seeds and are dispersed by birds.
