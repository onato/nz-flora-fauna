Coprosma serrulata is an erect to depressed bushy evergreen shrub growing to 1m in height and is endemic to montane to lower sub-alpine forests, shrublands and grasslands, from latitude 41Â°S southwards of the South Island, New Zealand. It is usually found growing amongst other lower growing shrubs and grasses.

The very thick, leathery, dark green leaves (4-7cm long) have minutely serrate margins and reticulated veins which are evident on both surfaces.
Coprosma serrulata is dioecious (separate male or female plants). The male plants have several flowers together on very short axillary peduncles while the female has only one flower per axillary peduncle. They are pollinated by the wind. The fruits are red and about 8mm long.
