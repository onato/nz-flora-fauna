Coprosma spathulata subsp. Hikuruana is a subspecies of Comprosma spathulata that is endemic to the gullies and cliff faces of the Surville Cliffs, North Cape, New Zealand. It differs from C. spathulata subsp. spathulata by its prostrate, trailing habit, narrow ellipsoid fruits, and restriction to areas of ultramafic rocks. Ultramafic rocks are igneous and meta-igneous with a very low silica content, generally, &gt;18% MgO, high FeO, low potassium, and are composed of usually greater than 90% mafic minerals. This subspecies is considered threatened by weeds, browsing mammals and fire.
