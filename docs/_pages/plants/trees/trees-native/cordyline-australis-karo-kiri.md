title: Cordyline australis 'Karo Kiri'

Cordyline 'Karo Kiri' is a unique dwarf New Zealand cabbage tree and was formally described and named C. australis 'Karo Kiri' (Heenan et al. 1994). It was granted New Zealand plant variety rights in 1993. PVR number: 782. 

This variation of C. australis was discovered in 1983 by Mr Trevor Bayliss, a nurseryman, Belfast, Christchurch
It is characterised by very short rigid leaves with distinct yellow midribs on their lower sides. Normally the growth is monopodial and the trunk will continue to elongate to a point where it no longer holds itself erect. Dead leaves accumulate along the trunk. Gardeners usually remove the dead basal leaves to create an interesting miniature palm effect. If the tree grows too tall the stem is cut to the desired height and new shoots will sprout.
