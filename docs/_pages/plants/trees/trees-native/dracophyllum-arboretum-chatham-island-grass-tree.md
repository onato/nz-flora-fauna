title: Dracophyllum arboreum (Chatham Island grass tree)

---
Dracophyllum arboreum is a distinctive dracophyllum with a tree habit (growing up to 18 m tall). It is endemic to Chatham Islands (Rekohu (Chatham), Rangiuria (Pitt ) and Rangatira (South East) Islands). 

Although it is dicotyledonous, they resemble primitive monocots having slender leaves concentrated in clumps at the ends of the branches, giving them the common name grass-trees.
The tree has a distinct juvenile phase with leaves that are broad. The older trees develop leaves that are narrow, this makes them wind-resistant.
The mature tree develops spikes of white flowers all year round.
