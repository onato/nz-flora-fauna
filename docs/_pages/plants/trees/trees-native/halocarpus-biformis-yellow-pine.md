Halocarpus biformis is a small dioecious small coniferous tree with spreading branches and a rounded crown and is endemic to New Zealand. 

Its soft 'whipcord' foliage forms a dark to yellow/green tree. It may have both juvenile and adult foliage at the same time.
The tree can attain heights of 10m, but in open areas, it is usually a low spreading bush. It is found at higher elevations in the volcanic plateau of the North Island and at lower elevations on the South Island and Stewart Island. It was part of Mt Egmont/Taranaki ancient scrub but is now absent.
