Pittosporum tenuifolium is a small evergreen tree with wavy silvery green, glossy leaves (up to 10 meters) native to New Zealand. The flowers generally go unnoticed because of their colour, a very dark reddish-purple, and are scented only at night. It is found growing wild in coastal and lower mountain forest areas up to an altitude of 900m. It hybridises readily, resulting in plants with very variable foliage. Provides food for native birds. Nectar during October-January. Fruit/seeds during February-June. It is attractive to bees.
