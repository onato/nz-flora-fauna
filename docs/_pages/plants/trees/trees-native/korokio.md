Corokia cotoneaster is a tangled shrub evergreen divaricating shrub endemic to New Zealand. It is naturally occurring throughout NZ in dry and stony places. It grows up to 3m high in sheltered places but in exposed sites, it will stay quite tight and compact. Its leaves are green and bronze with fine hairs on them. It will tolerate salt-laden winds.

This much-branched shrub grows to 3m with a tangle of tortured branches covered with smoky green leaves. It has small, simple open star-like yellow flowers (5 to 8mm diameter) in spring then red, yellow or orange drupes in autumn. 
It is visited by a wide range of insects, but a single species of native bee appears to be the effective pollinator.
There are a few cultivars originating from this plant such as Corokia 'Little Prince' and Corokia 'North Cape'.
Corokia cotoneaster North Cape is a cultivar of Corokia from North Cape area. It has a height: 0.4m and a spread: 0.6. It is an amazingly slow growing Corokia.  It remains as a low bush and will hang over a bank.
