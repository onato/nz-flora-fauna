Melicytus lanceolatus is a small fast growing native tree with an open habit and it can grow to a height of 5m or more and can have a trunk of 30 cm in diameter. The bark is white. 

It is found throughout the wetter areas of New Zealand in the cooler higher altitudes in valleys and basins. The leaves are toothed and willow/spear shaped and are often curved down towards the tip. 
Purple 5 mm flowers (male) appear from mid-winter to early summer. The female flowers are yellowish. Dark purple berries (4-6 mm) then develop and these contain 3-6 seeds. 
It is present on Mt Egmont/Taranaki.
