Olearia albida is an evergreen shrub or tree (up to 8m) found on coastal cliffs and coastal forests from North Cape to Taranaki. These trees may be multitrunked.

The leaves are green and leathery, broad spear-shaped leaves are 4â€“8 cm long, with strongly wavy edges; white or pale yellow-green beneath. In summer to autumn open clusters of white daisy flowers are produces. The seeds of these flowers are dispersed by the wind.
