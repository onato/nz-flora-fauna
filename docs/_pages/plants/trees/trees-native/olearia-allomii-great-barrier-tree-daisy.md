Olearia allomii is an endemic, evergreen small shrub > 1 m in height confined to Great Barrier Island in the Hauraki Gulf, northeast of Auckland. Its habitat is the island’s higher sites of skeletal soils of open shrubland (logged areas) and the crevices of rocky outcrops.

Olearia allomii has thick, alternate, entire, broadly dished, leathery leaves are 2.5 - 5cm long by 2 - 4cm wide and they have thick white stalks. The leaves are a shiny, dark green and they have an appressed, silvery tomentum underneath. The underside leaf’s midrib is very prominent.
Olearia allomii produces corymbs of many-stellate flowers from March to June. The ray florets (5-10) are white and the disc florets are mauve.
Olearia allomii is available for purchase from specialised native nurseries.
