title: Olearia solandri (Coastal shrub daisy)

---
Olearia solandri is a hardy native coastal bushy shrub or tree (height: 5m; spread: 3m),  found near the coast, (occasionally inland) in the North Island, and in Marlborough to the north of the South Island of New Zealand.

Mature plants have dark green spear-shaped leaves (5 â€“ 8 mm long) and are yellow below.
In autumn indiscernible small, highly scented, daisy flowers appear.
