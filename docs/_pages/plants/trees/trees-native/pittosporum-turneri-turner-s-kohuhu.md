Pittosporum turneri is a rare small native tree (up to 8 m tall) with a columnar growth form and is one of the divaricated Pittosporums. Its habitat is the margins of montane to subalpine forests of the central North Island, from southern Pureora in the Rangitoto Ranges between Lake Taupo and Te Kuiti to the Ruahine Range. It is not found on Mt Egmont/Taranaki.

During October to December, this small tree has red/pink night-scented flowers.
This rare shrubs adult foliage is a favourite of possums and it is suspected that saplings are eaten by deer and goats.
