Pomaderris phylicifolia is a rare nationally endangered, indigenous, small, open many branched shrub found only in the north of the North Island on scattered sites south to near Orewa. It is also found in Victoria and southern New South Wales in Australia. It inhabits nutrient-poor soils in mainly coastal areas, on roadsides and among open sites in scrub.

It grows &gt; 1.5m in height. The young stems and buds are usually covered in dense white hairs. Leaves are oblong, 10–25 mm long, and folded or rolled over on the edges with simple hairs on the upper surface and star-like hairs on the under-surface. Flowers are 4–5 mm diameter, grouped in clusters, cream to pale yellow and lack petals. Fruit is a 4 mm long capsule. Flowering occurs from October to November and fruiting occurs from November to January.
The early Maori use to hardened the roots by fire and then used them as fish hooks.
