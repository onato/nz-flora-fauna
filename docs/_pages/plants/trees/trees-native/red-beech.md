Fuscospora fusca (New Zealand Red Beech) is a species of Fuscospora, endemic to New Zealand, where it occurs on both the North Island and South Island. Generally, it is found on lower hills and inland valley floors where the soil is fertile and well drained. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 35 m tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, broadly ovoid, 2 to 4 cm long and 1.5 to 3 cm broad, the margin distinctively double-toothed with each lobe bearing two teeth. The fruit is a small cupule containing three seeds.
