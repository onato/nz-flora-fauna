Quintinia is an extremely variable plant. Some scientists consider it to be three separate species, calling two of its forms Quintinia acutifolia and Q. elliptica. 

Tawheowheo occurs in two distinct regions of New Zealand: it grows in lowland and mountain forests in the northern half of North Island, is absent from the southern North Island, then reappears in the west of the South Island as far south as Fox Glacier.
Tawheowheo grows to about 12 metres in height and has mottled, narrow leaves with wavy edges. It produces 5â€“10-centimetre spikes of tiny cream flowers in spring, and dry brown seed capsules in mid-summer. Te Henui This specimen was planted by NPDC some years ago on the Te henui walkway.
