Teucridium parvifolium is an erect, closely branched, softly wooded native shrub up to c. 1.5 m tall with branchlets that are square in cross-section and have small, single flowers that occur in the leaf axils. The flowers have five downy petals that are white or flushed with pale blue. Flowering occurs from October to January and fruiting is between the months of December and March.

Many of the small-leaved Coprosma species are similar but can be distinguished by having a round cross-section of the young stems and the presence of stipules.
The leaves (c. 4-12 mm long) have edges that are usually smooth but occasionally are irregularly and gently lobed.
T. parvifolium populations are scattered throughout the country, often with large distances separating them. It occurs from the Far North to Southland, although very rarely in large numbers. In Canterbury, there are a handful of sites around Kaikoura. The Banks Peninsula is home to a number of populations.
T. parvifolium habitat is mainly on slopes and alluvial terraces along forest margins, streambeds and under broken canopies. 
The causes of the decline of this plant are browsing animals, invasive weeds and habitat disruption. 
The IUCN threat classification is that of vulnerable.
