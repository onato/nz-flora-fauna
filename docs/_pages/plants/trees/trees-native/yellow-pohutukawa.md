The Yellow Pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa 'Aurea') is a rare colour form. It is a coastal evergreen tree in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, that produces a brilliant display of yellow flowers made up of a mass of stamens. This yellow-flowered form "Aurea" descends from a pair discovered in 1840 on Motiti Island of Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty by a Mr Potts. This coastal tree can reach 20m in height.

Below is part of an article in the New Zealand Garden Journal, 2010, Vol. 13(1)
"M. excelsa ‘Aurea’: a greenish yellow-ﬂowered variant that originated on Motiti Island in the Bay of Plenty. It was ﬁrst offered for sale in a 1947 Duncan &amp; Davies Nursery Catalogue (no. 97). For many years Duncan&amp; Davies produced it from seed only and all seedlings remained relatively true to type with yellow ﬂowers (Hobbs, 1992). Green (1975) incorrectly assumed that it was grown from cuttings to maintain its ﬂower colour. Metcalf (1987, 2000) states that all cultivated material is derived from two trees discovered on Motiti Island about 1940. Simpson (2005) states that naturally occurring yellow-ﬂowered variants are relatively common on Motiti Island."
This yellow species of Pohutukawa is a taonga to the Maori, a valued treasure.
